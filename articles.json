namesake sits at the center of this group portrait, Elihu Yale With Members of His Family and an Enslaved Child (circa 1719, attributed to John Verelst). Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, eleventh Duke of Devonshire For decades, an unsettling portrait of Yale University\u2019s namesake and early benefactor, British American colonist Elihu Yale, carried a maddeningly incomplete description. The painting shows four white men in costly 18th-century outfits posing around a table, with Yale at the center. As the men smoke and sip madeira, Yale\u2019s grandchildren play in the field behind them. In the right corner of the canvas, a child of African descent pours wine for the group. He wears fine red and grey clothes and\u2014most disturbingly\u2014a silver collar locked around his neck. First donated to the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) in 1970 and exhibited sporadically over the past five decades, the painting was initially displayed with wall text that listed the men\u2019s titles but did not mention the enslaved child at their side. When the gallery was rehung in 2016, a new line acknowledged little beyond the boy\u2019s apparel: \u201cNothing is known ... except that his livery identifies him as a servant, and the padlocked collar indicates that he is enslaved.\u201d A boy of African descent, estimated to be about 10 years old, serves madeira to the wealthy white men at the table. Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire Unanswered questions about the enslaved child haunted New Haven resident Titus Kaphar when he first saw the portrait in 2016. Inspired, the artist painted Enough About You, which warps the 18th-century work beyond recognition, save for the boy\u2019s portrait, which is framed in gold. Kaphar\u2019s subject stares directly at the viewer and does not wear a collar. As the artist told Terence Trouillot of Artnet Newsin 2019, \u201cI decided to physically take action to quiet [and crumple] the side of the painting that we\u2019ve been talking about for a very long time and turn up the volume on this kid\u2019s story.\u201d Four years after Kaphar created Enough About You, the YCBA embarked on a project to do just that. Last fall, after a landmark summer of protests against racial injustice, director Courtney J. Martin decided to temporarily remove the Yale group portrait from view. The museum hung Kaphar\u2019s painting, on an eight-month loan from private collectors in California, in its place. Meanwhile, a group of five YCBA employees volunteered to research the enslaved child and his portrait in new depth. Software engineer Eric James, senior curatorial assistant Abigail Lamphier, senior library assistant Lori Misura, coordinator of cataloging David K. Thompson and assistant curator Edward Town published their initial findings online earlier this year. Viewers can explore the report via the YCBA website and the related Yale and Slavery Research Project website. As of this week, members of the public can once again view the reinstalled Yale portrait, bolstered by rewritten wall texts that add newfound historical context to the image, as Nancy Kenney reports for the Art Newspaper. \u201cHow long will it stay [up]? That\u2019s the answer I don\u2019t have just yet,\u201d Martin tells the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe conversation is evolving.\u201d Titus Kaphar, Enough About You, 2016 Photo by Richard Caspole \/ Collection of Arthur Lewis and Hau Nguyen \/ Courtesy of the artist The painting\u2019s new label holds several revelations from the researchers. Whereas previous estimates had dated the portrait to 1708, chemical analysis conducted in the past year now suggests that it was completed around 1719. The experts also ascribed the formerly unattributed work to John Verelst, a Dutch portraitist working in Britain during that period, and retitled it Elihu Yale With Members of His Family and an Enslaved Child. Though the team has yet to uncover the identity of the Black child, Town tells Smithsonian that he still has hope. Scholars sometimes argue that European artists did not paint people of African or Indian descent from real-life models but instead invented from fabricated stereotypes\u2014an assumption that strikes Town as \u201cunsatisfying and wrong.\u201d \u201cThe full story hasn\u2019t yet been told,\u201d he says. Recovering the child\u2019s biography \u201cmight prove impossible, but it is still the goal here.\u201d Despite lacking a name for the child, the YCBA team has managed to flesh out some details of his life and status. Based on input from pediatricians, the team estimates that he was about 10 years old. He would have been one of many people, mostly boys under the age of 10, taken from their families in British colonies in Africa and India and forced to work as enslaved \u201cpages\u201d in the households of wealthy white men. (This work in particular was probably painted at Yale\u2019s house in London.) The child\u2019s enslavers also forced him to wear a padlocked collar. As the Art Newspaper reports, this was a common practice: YCBA researchers have identified at least 50 other paintings made in Britain between 1660 and 1760 that depict enslaved individuals wearing similar collars, sometimes engraved with an enslaver\u2019s name or other identifying marks. \u201cThis collar is not used to tether someone to another set of chains, in the way that a similar-looking object would be in Jamaica or Barbados at the same time,\u201d says Town. Rather, \u201c[o]ne of the invidious, cruelest things about it is that these collars would have been highly finished, high-status objects.\u201d As instruments of control, the bands symbolically marked their wearers as enslaved and prevented them from easily running away. Town is careful to qualify that the precise details of this child\u2019s bondage would have differed from the experiences of enslaved people in the British colonies, where slavery was codified by law. Chattel slavery technically had \u201cno legal basis\u201d in England, per Historic U.K. But many Black people were forced to work in British households in \u201can ill-defined but often violently enforced state of what historians have characterized as \u2018slavish servitude,\u2019\u201d the researchers write. (The slippery legal semantics around enslavement within Britain\u2019s shoreline would later be tested in court, most notably in the 1772 case of James Somerset, adds Town.) The child\u2019s precise relationship with the four men in the painting is likewise unclear. Some clues have come to light: for instance, the man standing at Yale\u2019s shoulder is newly identified as David Yale, the patriarch\u2019s adopted heir. He looms over Lord James Cavendish, to the left of Yale, and a figure now identified as Yale\u2019s son-in-law William Cavendish, on the right. In other words, this is a family portrait that Yale likely commissioned near the end of his life to promote his power and legacy, says Town. Born in 1649 in Boston, the merchant made his fortune during a 20-year tenure working for (and stealing from) the East India Company in present-day Chennai (then called Madras). He later retired in luxury to Wales and England. In 1718, he donated a set of expensive goods to the future Yale University, lending the young Connecticut college its name. Town and historian Teanu Reid note that the extent of Yale\u2019s direct involvement in the trade of enslaved people remains unclear. But other scholars argue that he certainly would have benefited and profited from the trade indirectly, as Mark Alden Branch reported for Yale Alumni magazine last year. No known written records prove that Yale personally enslaved people. His private papers are missing\u2014a fact that further complicates efforts to determine how the young boy ended up painted into a group portrait. This lack of a paper trail means that researchers can\u2019t say for certain whether Yale or one of his relatives claimed ownership of the child. That being said, \u201c[f]or me, it\u2019s splitting hairs, because they\u2019re all one social and economic and familial unit,\u201d says Town. James Worsdale painted this work, Elihu Yale With His Servant, sometime in the 18th century. The painting was removed from public display in 2007. Public domain via Yale University Art Gallery Research into the boy\u2019s identity and story is ongoing. Archivists are currently investigating regional archives located near the estates of Yale and his sons-in-law, who owned properties in Suffolk, Buckinghamshire and Derbyshire, for clues about their lives, businesses and households, per the Art Newspaper. While Yale\u2019s relationship to the institution of slavery is subject to historical debate, he was certainly comfortable sitting for portraits that featured enslaved people. Of the seven painted likenesses of Yale in the university\u2019s holdings, three depict him alongside an enslaved person: the aforementioned family portrait attributed to Verelst, a rendition of the same group on copper and a separate full-length portrait that once hung in the university\u2019s Corporation Room. The last of these, which was removed from public view in 2007 due to its racist themes, shows an enslaved adult of Indian or South Asian heritage walking up to Yale and holding out a letter. The artist, James Worsdale, attempts to marginalize the figure of the servant, depicting him as emerging from the shadows and rendering him as slight compared to Yale\u2019s imposing bulk. Similarly, Verelst painted the young African boy in the corner of his group composition. In a 2014 YCBA exhibition, curators asked attendees to disobey these visual cues and instead consider the enslaved child in the portrait as if he were the focus of the work. As Kaphar demonstrated with Enough About You, artists can encourage members of the public to \u201creframe\u201d portraits like Elihu Yale, literally and figuratively. \u201cI wanted to find a way to imagine a life for this young man that the historical painting had never made space for in the composition: his desires, dreams, family, thoughts, hopes,\u201d Kaphar told Artnet News in 2019. \u201cThose things were never subjects that the original artist wanted the viewer to contemplate.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Photo by Drew Angerer \/ Getty Images Last year, amid an outpouring of rage and grief over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, a string of monuments honoring the Confederacy came down across the country. Some were removed by city officials; others were toppled by protesters. Speaking with Fox News last June, then-President Donald Trump spoke out against the push to take these controversial monuments down, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away our heritage and history and the beauty, in many cases, the beauty, the artistic beauty.\u201d It\u2019s an argument oft repeated when public tributes to the Confederacy face removal. These monuments, critics say, represent heritage and Southern pride, and taking them down is tantamount to erasing history. But many others view the monuments as symbols of racism and intimidation, honoring an illegitimate entity that sought to preserve the institutions of white supremacy and slavery. After all, proponents of pulling down statues point out, most Confederate monuments were erected decades after the end of the Civil War, at a time when Black Americans\u2019 civil rights were \u201caggressively under attack,\u201d in the words of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Ryan Best. This map visualizes the researchers' findings, with darker colors denoting higher numbers of lynching victims and each dot representing the location of a Confederate memorialization. Graphic by Samuel Powers \/ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Now, reports Gillian Brockell for the Washington Post, a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences outlines evidence that Confederate monuments are indeed linked to a history of racial violence. Researchers at the University of Virginia (UVA) found that in former Confederate states, counties with higher numbers of Confederate monuments had higher numbers of lynchings between 1832 and 1950\u2014a trend \u201cconsistent with the position that Confederate memorializations reflect a racist history, one marred by intentions to terrorize and intimidate Black Americans in response to Black progress,\u201d according to the study. White mobs committed brutal acts of extrajudicial violence against nearly 2,000 Black Americans during Reconstruction (1865\u20131876), a tumultuous period following the Civil War during which the country\u2019s laws and Constitution were reworked to grant basic rights to the formerly enslaved. These lynchings were \u201cintended to maintain white supremacy, suppress civil rights, instill fear and terrorize Black people,\u201d the authors write in the study. The researchers focused their investigation on the areas where the most lynchings took place: the 11 former Confederate states of Virginia, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas and Alabama. They obtained county-level data on lynching from two sources, including an Equal Justice Initiative registry documenting racially motivated killings that took between 1877 and 1950. County-level counts of Confederate memorials came from the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Whose Heritage? project, which tracks monuments that have been removed and those that still stand. Photograph of the 1913 unveiling of UNC Chapel Hill's Silent Sam monument Public domain via Wikimedia Commons Even when controlling for demographic factors like population numbers, the researchers found that \u201ccounty-level frequency of lynching predicts county-level frequency of Confederate memorializations.\u201d The paper does not make any causal claims, and the researchers \u201ccan\u2019t pinpoint exactly the cause and effect,\u201d says co-author Sophie Trawalter, an expert on public policy and psychology at UVA, in a statement. \u201cBut,\u201d Trawalter adds, \u201cthe association is clearly there. At a minimum, the data suggests that localities with attitudes and intentions that led to lynchings also had attitudes and intentions associated with the construction of Confederate memorials.\u201d The findings become even more powerful, the researchers say, when one considers the times and places that the monuments were erected, as well as the contents of speeches given at the memorials\u2019 dedications. As an example, the paper cites a speech delivered by a Confederate veteran at the 1913 dedication ceremony for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Silent Sam monument. He claimed that Confederate soldiers \u201csaved the very life of the Anglo-Saxon race in the South\u201d and stated that he had publicly whipped a Black woman after the conclusion of the Civil War. Per the paper, the team hopes that its findings, which provide empirical data showing a correlation between Confederate monuments and racial terror killings, will help Americans move on from the debate over controversial statues\u2014and perhaps gain some clarity on how to deal with these public works. \u201cThis kind of [research] is important because it takes a debate that feels like two sides, that feels like two equally valid opinions, and contributes by acknowledging that there are empirical questions at the center of these debates,\u201d first author Kyshia Henderson, a psychologist at UVA, tells Erin O\u2019Hare of Charlottesville Tomorrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to yield to the position that these symbols are not at all associated with hate.

Officials later removed the sculpture, ostensibly for restoration. Photo by Guillermo Guti\u00e9rrez \/ NurPhoto via Getty Images Editor's Note, October 14, 2021: Officials in Mexico City will replace a statue of Christopher Columbus with a monumental replica of The Young Woman of Amajac, a pre-Hispanic limestone sculpture discovered in Mexico\u2019s Huasteca region earlier this year, reports David Agren for the Guardian. The announcement follows widespread criticism of a previously proposed replacement sculpted by artist Pedro Reyes. Read more about Reyes' statue\u2014and the controversial likeness of Columbus\u2014below.A pedestal in the center of Mexico City that once hosted a statue of Christopher Columbus has stood empty since last October. Now, reports Johnny Diaz for the New York Times, a sculpture of an Indigenous woman is set to replace the controversial explorer\u2019s likeness. Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans for the new statue last Sunday, on Mexico\u2019s Day of the Indigenous Woman. Designed by Mexican sculptor Pedro Reyes, the soon-to-be installed statue is titled Tlalli\u2014the Nahuatl word for water. It depicts a woman from the Olmec civilization, which inhabited present-day Mexico between roughly 1400 and 400 B.C.E., as Taylor Dafoe writes for Artnet News. The first major civilization in Mexico, the Olmec are best known today for their massive sculptures of human heads. \u201cIt is very important to dedicate a monument to Indigenous women and to the earth, because if someone can teach us how to take care of this planet, it is our native peoples and that is precisely what we must learn again,\u201d Reyes tells Mexican newspaper El Universal, per a translation by Artnet News. \u201cWe all come from the land and we all return to it, and it is the land that should be in our mind\u2014and not only in the past.\u201d En el marco del #D\u00edaInternacionalDeLaMujerInd\u00edgena anunciamos que en la glorieta donde se ubicaba la estatua de Col\u00f3n, se colocar\u00e1 una escultura que reivindica a las mujeres, de cara a los #500A\u00f1osDeResistenciaInd\u00edgena.#CiudadDeDerechos pic.twitter.com\/4CinthlvDY\u2014 Gobierno CDMX (@GobCDMX) September 5, 2021 Last October, city authorities pulled the 19th-century Columbus statue from its pedestal in the Paseo de la Reforma, a major street that cuts through the heart of Mexico City. Though officials claimed that the work was removed for restoration, some onlookers suspected that the decision was made in anticipation of protests on D\u00eda de la Raza, as Columbus Day is known in Spanish-speaking countries. Protesters routinely defaced the sculpture with spray paint during demonstrations, the Associated Press (AP) reported at the time. Sculpted by French artist Charles Cordier in 1877, the bronze statue depicts Italian explorer Columbus as a conqueror. He stands with one hand raised and the other lifting a veil off of a globe. Columbus\u2019 gesture refers to an outdated history that casts the explorer as the \u201cdiscoverer\u201d of the Americas. In truth, Columbus ventured to the Caribbean in 1492 and met the Ta\u00edno people\u2014one of many civilizations that had been living across North America for tens of thousands of years. The explorer enslaved and killed thousands of Indigenous people; his actions paved the way for European colonization of the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade. A 1909 photograph of the Christopher Columbus statue Public domain via Wikimedia Commons For now, reports the Times, the Columbus statue will be relocated to Parque Am\u00e9rica, in Mexico City\u2019s wealthy Polanco neighborhood. Last year, as protests against racial injustice swept the globe, protesters toppled Columbus statues around the world in symbolic acts of resistance against racism and colonialism. Activists also targeted statues of enslavers and Confederate monuments. At last week\u2019s press conference, Sheinbaum said that a statue honoring Mexicans\u2019 Indigenous heritage was long overdue. \u201cWe\u2019ll place a statue dedicated to the Indigenous woman,\u201d she added, per the Times. \u201cWe owe it to them.

Each day, she peered inside the windows and watched the animators at work\u2014until someone took notice of her and invited her inside. \u201cI think it was Walt [Disney] because he roamed around quite a bit,\u201d Tompson later recalled. She became such a fixture at the studio that Walt\u2019s brother, Roy, brought an apple box for her to sit on, transfixed, as animations came to life around her. \u201c[A]s it got late, he would say, \u2018I think you\u2019d better go home. Your mother probably wants you to come home for dinner.\u2019\u201d These visits marked the start of Tompson\u2019s long, fruitful association with the Walt Disney Company. After graduating from high school, she formally joined the studio as an inker and painter, transferring animators\u2019 drawings from paper onto \u201ccels,\u201d or celluloid sheets used in the filmmaking process. Over the next 40-odd years, she took on roles in final check, scene planning and the camera department. Her work\u2014\u201dlargely unheralded,\u201d writes Margalit Fox for the New York Times\u2014helped shape many of the beloved children\u2019s films produced during Disney\u2019s Golden Age, among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. Tompson retired from Disney in 1975. Walt Disney Company On October 10, at the age of 111, Tompson \u201cpassed away peacefully in her sleep\u201d at her home in the Motion Picture and Television Fund\u2019s retirement community in Woodland Hills, California, Disney announced in a statement. \u201cRuthie was a legend among animators,\u201d says Bob Iger, executive chairman of the Walt Disney Company, in the statement. \u201cWhile we will miss her smile and wonderful sense of humor, her exceptional work and pioneering spirit will forever be an inspiration to us all.\u201d Born in Portland, Maine, in 1910, Tompson moved to California with her family when she was 8 years old. Her childhood was suffused with Disney: She lived down the street from Robert Disney, Walt\u2019s uncle, and in addition to being a regular observer of the Disney film studio, appeared as a live-action reference model for an early series of shorts, the Alice Comedies. She received 25 to 50 cents for each picture and used the money to buy licorice. When she was 18, Tompson took a job at a riding academy in the San Fernando Valley, where the Disney brothers often played polo. Though he had not seen her since she was a child, Walt recognized her \u201csignature Buster Brown haircut,\u201d and invited her to work with him, wrote Patricia Zohn for Vanity Fair in 2010. Tompson replied that she couldn\u2019t \u201cdraw worth a nickel,\u201d but Disney was undeterred, promising that the studio would send her to night school so she could learn the craft of inking and painting. The first film Tompson worked on was the studio\u2019s first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She joined a group of about 100 women, some of them \u201cprofoundly gifted artists\u201d who were barred from animation jobs because of their gender, per the Times. Tompson didn\u2019t have the steady, delicate touch needed to work with the inkers, who \u201cnot only had to trace the animators\u2019 pencil lines exactly but also had to capture the feeling of what the animators were intending in the scenes,\u201d according to the Walt Disney Family Museum. Instead, she was assigned to paint in the lines that had been traced by the inkers. Soon, Tompson was promoted to the position of final checker, making her responsible for reviewing animation cels before they were photographed onto film. \u201cOut of a 500-cel scene, every four or five would be painted by a different girl, so the colors had to follow through,\u201d she explained in 2007. \u201cIf they put blue in the wrong place, we\u2019d have to take them back and have them redo them.\u201d In 1948, Tompson began working as both an animation checker reviewing artists\u2019 work for inconsistencies and a scene planner\u2014a role that required her to guide how the camera should move to bring vitality to the animations. Tompson was named a Disney legend in 2000. Walt Disney Company \u201cShe really had to know all the mechanics of making the image work on the screen as the director, the layout person and the animator preferred: how to make Peter Pan walk, or fly, in the specified time,\u201d John Canemaker, a historian and Oscar-winning animator, tells the Times. \u201cWhat she did ended up on the screen\u2014whether you see her hand or not\u2014because of the way she supported the directors\u2019 vision.\u201d Though she operated behind the scenes, Tompson\u2019s technical skill was recognized when she became one of the first three women admitted to the International Photographers Union, reports Rachel Treisman for NPR. She continued working for Disney until her retirement from the studio in 1975, making invaluable contributions to \u201cvirtually every Disney animated feature up through The Rescuers,\u201d per the statement. In 2000, Tompson was named a Disney Legend, a title bestowed for exceptional contributions to the company. Last year, in honor of Tompson\u2019s 110th birthday, a celebration was held at the Motion Picture & Television Fund campus. Staff decorated the halls according to Tompson\u2019s two passions: Disney and the Dodgers. When asked the secret to her longevity, Tompson joked that she was a vampire before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am still here, but I know that I don\u2019t want to be revered for how old I am.

FlickrDelusions via Flickr under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 The University of Oxford\u2019s Oriel College has installed a plaque identifying 19th-century politician and diamond-mining magnate Cecil Rhodes as a \u201ccommitted British colonialist.\u201d Placed beside a much-debated statue of Rhodes, the plaque immediately came under fire from both advocates of removing the sculpture and their opponents. Oxford city councilor Shaista Aziz, who was a member of the college\u2019s Independent Commission of Inquiry into the statue, calls the plaque \u201camateurish\u201d and \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d reports Indya Clayton for the Oxford Mail. Aziz adds that the sign does \u201cnothing to address the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, a loud, proud white supremacist, colonialist and slave owner and a deeply controversial figure of his time.\u201d The new plaque notes that the building where the statue stands was constructed with money bequeathed by Rhodes in his will. Upon his death in 1902, Rhodes, a former Oriel student, left the college the equivalent of about $17 million in today\u2019s dollars. The plaque states that Rhodes \"obtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\" Dan Hicks via Twitter Per the sign, Rhodes \u201cobtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\u201d Though the college \u201cdeclared its wish to remove the statue\u201d following widespread protests against systemic racism last year, it opted not to do so in accordance with \u201clegal and regulatory advice.\u201d A line at the bottom of the plaque directs readers to a website featuring additional context about the statue and Rhodes himself. Cambridge historian David Abulafia tells the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Turner that the sign \u201clacks balance.\u201d \u201cHe believed he was bringing benefits to Africa,\u201d Abulafia says. \u201cWe might now argue that he did more harm than good, but one has to understand what his intentions were. He is portrayed here as some sort of devil incarnate.\u201dAs an @OrielOxford alumnus I am dismayed to see the sniveling cowardice shown in the face of the left-wing mob.

Linking Rhodes\u2019 legacy to continuing inequity in wealth and opportunities in the country, protesters successfully campaigned for the removal of a prominent statue of Rhodes at the University of Cape Town. Founder of the De Beers diamond company, Rhodes served as prime minister of Britain\u2019s Cape Colony, in what\u2019s now South Africa, from 1890 to 1896. In addition to profiting enormously from the region\u2019s mineral wealth, Rhodes advocated for monumental expansion of the British Empire, including bringing the United States back under British control. He sought to create a \u201cred line\u201d on the map of Africa, with everything from Cairo to Cape Town belonging to Britain. \u201cI contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race,\u201d Rhodes once said. Last year, in the midst of global activism following the police killing of George Floyd, activists in Oxford demanded the removal of Rhode\u2019s likeness. Protesters around the world also toppled statues of other figures linked to slavery and colonialism, including Confederate generals and enslavers. In Bristol, an English city west of Oxford, a crowd dumped a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston into a nearby harbor.the Rhodes Must Fall Oxford campaign did not, from memory, call for the erection of a third college memorial to Cecil Rhodesthis small metal sign is an embarrassment and reveals the incoherence and futility of the ideology of \u201cRetain and Explain\u201d pic.twitter.com\/Ft50hPpVQ4\u2014 Dan Hicks (@profdanhicks) October 11, 2021 A majority of the independent commission\u2019s members supported removing Oriel\u2019s Rhodes statue.

Directorate of Gallipoli Historic Site Ready to take a deep dive into history\u2014literally? Scuba divers can now explore the hulks of British and French ships sunk off the coast of Turkey during World War I\u2019s Gallipoli Campaign. Tourism officials have transformed the century-old wrecks in the Dardanelles Strait into a \u201cmuseum under the sea,\u201d reports Diego Cupolo for the London Times.

The Allies abandoned the campaign 11 months later, in January 1916, and the disgraced Churchill retreated from politics for nearly 20 years. He would return to office in 1940, leading Great Britain to victory in World War II as prime minister. The Allies\u2019 failure at Gallipoli owed much to Ottoman commander Kemal, who succeeded in preventing British and French forces from advancing past their beachheads in several key battles. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Kemal helped establish the Republic of Turkey as a secular state and adopted the surname of Atat\u00fcrk, or \u201cFather Turk.\u201d Today, residents of Turkey view the Ottoman victory at Gallipoli as a defining moment for the end of the empire and the birth of a new nation.

S. Campbell \/ Antiquity An obsidian \u201cspirit mirror\u201d used by John Dee, an advisor to England\u2019s Elizabeth I, traces its origins to Aztec culture, a new study published in the journal Antiquity suggests. A Renaissance polymath whose interests ranged from astronomy to astrology, alchemy and math, Dee advised the queen from the start of her reign in 1558 to the 1570s. As court astrologer and scientific advisor, he advocated for overseas exploration and the establishment of colonies. \u201cLater he became involved in divination and the occult, seeking to talk to angels through the use of scryers (those who divine the future), who used artifacts\u2014like mirrors and crystals,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, University of Manchester archaeologist Stuart Campbell, tells Ashley Strickland of CNN. Today, the British Museum owns the mirror, which is on display in London alongside two similar circular obsidian mirrors and a rectangular obsidian slab that may be a portable altar, reports Tom Metcalfe for National Geographic. Researchers had previously suspected that the artifacts originated with the Aztecs, and the new study confirms this chemically. Aztec codices created around the time of the Spanish Conquest depict mirrors, apparently in frames. The Trustees of the British Museum Using a portable X-ray fluorescence scanner, the team measured the proportions of titanium, iron, strontium and other substances and compared them with those found in obsidian from Mexico. The scholars determined that Dee\u2019s mirror and one of the others originated in Pachuca, just northeast of Mexico City, while the third mirror and the slab came from Ucareo, about 150 miles west. Both regions were under Aztec control in the early 16th century. The Aztecs used obsidian for medicinal purposes and viewed its reflective surface as a shield against bad spirits. The volcanic glass was also associated with death, the underworld, and capturing the image and soul of a person. Like other Mesoamericans, the Aztecs saw mirrors as doorways to other worlds, \u201cmuch like Alice in Through the Looking Glass,\u201d Karl Taube, an anthropologist at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new study, tells National Geographic. \u201cOnce you deeply gaze in, you have opened up that connection.\u201d The Aztec god Tezcatlipoca, or \u201cSmoking Mirror,\u201d is frequently depicted wearing mirrors that allow him to see humans\u2019 thoughts and actions. As Campbell tells Live Science\u2019s Mindy Weisberger, \u201c[T]here\u2019s quite a specific association with these types of mirrors and that particular deity.\u201d Codices, or manuscripts, made by Indigenous people around the time of the Spanish Conquest depict circular mirrors in what appear to be frames, the study\u2019s authors write. Most examples of such artifacts date to the later part of the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period, which spanned roughly 900 to 1520 C.E. Indigenous people may have continued to produce the mirrors in the early colonial era. Forces under the command of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n in 1521. They quickly began shipping treasures, including obsidian mirrors, back to Europe. John Dee was a mathematician, astrologer, alchemist and advisor to England's Elizabeth I. Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford Exactly when Dee\u2019s mirror arrived in Europe\u2014and how the scholar acquired the artifact\u2014remains unclear. But Gizmodo\u2019s George Dvorsky notes that Dee was interested in the Spanish Conquest and had probably heard stories about obsidian mirrors. At the time, many European scholars and nobles were fascinated by objects arriving on the continent from distant cultures. Speaking with Gizmodo, Campbell says the research \u201chelps us understand something of the way in which the European voyages of discovery and engagement with other parts of the world\u2014often through disastrous conquest\u2014was matched by new intellectual attempts to understand how the world worked.\u201d According to Garry Shaw of the Art Newspaper, Dee may have bought the mirror in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) in the 1580s. By that time, he was becoming increasingly interested in the occult practices of mediums who supposedly used mirrors and crystal balls to communicate with angels and other supernatural beings. \u201cMirrors have a long history of use within European magical practices,\u201d Campbell tells the Art Newspaper. \u201cSo the attraction of a mirror of a novel material, coming from an exotic culture with stories of its use for divination, and the drama of seeing dimly reflected images within it probably made it a very tempting object for [Dee] to use.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Dated to around 1,800 years ago, the nearly seven-inch-tall female figure was found ahead of construction of a $145 million, multi-use commercial development called the Forum, reports BBC News in a separate article. (Interestingly, the Latin word forum refers to the central public square in an ancient Roman city.) Archaeologist Dani Hurst holds the statuette found at the dig site in Gloucestershire, England. Cotswold Archaeology \u201cWe know pieces like these were made in central France and the Rhineland\/Mosel region of Germany during the first and second centuries [C.E.],\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cIt seems certain the figurine is from this period and is a representation of Venus. She would most likely have stood in someone\u2019s home shrine for the goddess.\u201d Known for her amorous abilities, Venus was the Roman goddess of love, beauty, victory, fertility and prostitution. Julius Caesar, who invaded Britain twice, in 55 and 54 B.C.E., claimed to be a descendant of the deity. Roman legions conquered much of Britain beginning in 43 C.E. Gloucestershire, located about 90 miles west of London, was established as a Roman fort known as Glevum in 48 C.E. Dani Hurst of Cotswold Archaeology discovered the clay statuette in September. \u201cThis has been the most exciting find of my career in archaeology so far,\u201d colleague Anthony Beechey tells BBC News. \u201cThe figurine provides an important tangible link between the people of Gloucester and their past.\u201d The clay figurine is intact aside from a missing base. Cotswold Archaeology Speaking with BBC News, lead archaeologist Marino Cardelli deems the Venus statuette of \u201cinestimable historical value ... a testimony of the city\u2019s history and culture.\u201d The figurine is made of pipeclay, a white clay found along the Rhine and Meuse rivers in what is now Germany. It is intact except for a missing base. Nearby, the team found ruins associated with Whitefriars, a medieval Carmelite friary. Last year, Cotswold Archaeology and Gloucester City Council discovered Whitefriars\u2019 remains beneath a demolished parking garage. \u201cWe\u2019d already discovered the medieval Carmelite friary and were hand-digging a new route for a culvert when Dani discovered [Venus] covered in mud, in what would have been a Roman rubbish dump,\u201d Armstrong tells Melanie Greenwood of Gloucestershire Live. \u201cOnly its base was broken.\u201d According to BBC News, the team also unearthed the stone foundations of buildings that may have belonged to a suburb outside the Roman fort. \u201cFinding this statue, as well as the priory, has exceeded all my expectations,\u201d Armstrong tells Gloucestershire Live. \u201cIt was beyond my wildest hopes.

They are also asking residents near Golden to check for video, such as dash cam footage, from October 3 at 11:33 p.m. that may have captured a glimpse of the fireball. (Pictured: A shooting star streaks across a starry sky in British Columbia; image is not associated with the incident.) Preserved Light Photography via Getty Images When Ruth Hamilton awoke on October 3 to the sound of her dog barking, followed shortly by an explosion and drywall debris falling on her face, she was afraid there was an intruder in the house, she tells Claire Palmer at the Pipestone Flyer. She was on the telephone with an emergency operator when she noticed a dark gray rock behind her pillows that matched the fist-sized hole in her ceiling. The police officer who visited Hamilton\u2019s home in Golden, British Columbia, first suspected a nearby construction site might have been to blame for the projectile. But there was no blasting at the site that night. Instead, the construction workers tipped the officer off to another explanation. They heard booming and saw an explosion in the sky just before Hamilton reported the impact. \u201cThe police officer came back in and said: \u2018Well, I think you have meteorite in your bed,\u2019\" says Hamilton to CTV News Vancouver\u2019s David Molko. The meteorite weighs about 2.8 pounds and is the size of a large adult fist, per John Yoon and Vjosa Isai at the New York Times. Hamilton shared the meteorite with researchers at the University of Western Ontario, which has a collection of meteorites, so they can study the extraterrestrial intruder. \"It's certainly a meteorite,\" says University of Western Ontario meteor physicist Peter Brown to CBC News. \"Everything about the story was consistent with a meteorite fall, and the fact that this bright fireball had occurred basically right at the same time made it a pretty overwhelming case.\" The researchers plan to to gather images, measurements and possibly samples of the meteorite, per CTV News. They are also asking residents near Golden to check for video, such as dash cam footage, from October 3 at 11:33 p.m. that may have captured a glimpse of the fireball. Researchers can use video to reconstruct the path that the meteorite followed from the asteroid belt to Earth, says Brown to the Vancouver Sun. On average, fewer than ten meteorites are recovered each year; most meteors burn up in the atmosphere, and many land in the wilderness or the ocean. But just last year, a meteorite crash-landed in an Indonesian home, Andreas Illmer reported for BBC News at the time. Only one person, Ann Hodges, has ever survived a meteorite strike. Like Hamilton, Hodges was at home when the meteorite burst through the ceiling. The nine-pound meteorite bounced off a radio and hit Hodges\u2019 thigh, leaving a deep bruise. Hamilton considers herself lucky to have escaped the encounter without injury. \u201cI never got hurt,\u201d she tells the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through this experience, and I never even got a scratch. So all I had to do is have a shower and wash the drywall dust away.\u201d By the end of November, the meteorite will return to Hamilton\u2019s care. Because it landed on her property, the meteorite belongs to Hamilton, and she plans to keep it. It is not only a souvenir of the unusual night, she tells the Pipestone Flyer.

As we celebrate, like a true champ 480 is still chowing down. pic.twitter.com\/rLvm7pvGJW\u2014 Katmai National Park (@KatmaiNPS) October 6, 2021 It\u2019s that time of year again: the leaves are changing, the days are getting shorter, and the bears are getting chunkier. Every fall, some of the largest brown bears in the world gorge themselves on sockeye salmon at Brooks River in Katmai National Park, Alaska. To the delight of internet onlookers, the slender bears prepare for hibernation by ballooning into fluffy brown blimps. \u201cFat Bear Week is really a celebration of success and survival,\u201d says Lian Law, a visual information specialist at Katmai, to Natalie B. Compton for the Washington Post. \u201cWe really highlight the resilience and adaptability of bears here.\u201d Each day of Fat Bear Week, which spans from September 29 to October 5, the public is asked to choose between the \u201cfattest of the fat\u201d in online daily mashups. Voters can judge the bears on any combination of criteria\u2014floofiness, chonkiness, or inexplicable charm. Enthusiasts can also download their own March Madness\u2013style bracket and watch the bears feast via a live river cam. The bear with the most votes each day advances until one girthy goober is crowned the champion on \"Fat Bear Tuesday,\" which falls on October 5 this year. The first iteration of the competition took place in 2014 as a single-day event and has since soared in popularity. In 2019, more than 200,000 votes were cast. Last year, the number grew to more than 600,000 votes. The official Fat Bear Week 2021 Bracket Katmai National Park and Preserve via Flickr The annual tournament celebrates the bears\u2019 success in preparation for their long winter hibernation, but it\u2019s also become part of a conservation movement. Though the bears are reaching peak fatness this week, Fat Bear Week is an entire summer of eating in the making. The bears eat around 90 pounds of fish, berries, small mammals, and vegetation each day to pack on the pounds necessary to survive months of winter hibernation. They\u2019ll lose over a third of their body fat during their winter snooze, which lasts about six months. If the brown bears don\u2019t have access to calorie-rich foods like salmon, they may not survive the winter. \u201cIt really does raise awareness about their ecosystem,\u201d Law says to the Washington Post. \u201cWe are holding these Brooks bears and the Brooks area as an exemplary illustration of a healthy ecosystem...So, yes, we are celebrating the success of these bears, but it\u2019s important also not to forget that not all the bears and all of those places are so fortunate.\u201d This years\u2019 late salmon run hasn\u2019t deterred hordes of bears from seeking salmon in the Brooks River, according to a National Parks Service press release. The lumbering creatures appear to have had no problem plumping up. \"They are pretty massive,\" says Naomi Boak, the media ranger at Katmai National Park and Preserve, to Mashable\u2019s Mark Kaufman. Here are a few of this year\u2019s finest floofers: 747 747, whose build coincidentally resembles the Boeing airliner, is last year\u2019s defending champ. National Parks Service and Explore.org As last year\u2019s champion, some expect 747 to clinch a back-to-back victory. In September 2020, scientists estimated he weighed more than 1,400 pounds and he appears even bigger this year. According to Explore.org, 747 yielded to the river\u2019s most dominant bear, 856, for many years until this summer 2021. \u201cHe's the fattest and largest bear I've ever seen,\" said Mike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger and currently a resident naturalist for explore.org, to Mashable last year. \"I feel a special bit of privilege to witness a bear as big as he.\" In July, 747 trumped his long-time rival to become the river\u2019s top bear. 747 rarely has to get aggressive with others\u2014most bears recognize they\u2019re no match for his sheer size and stay out of his way. 128 \u201cGrazer\u201d Grazer is one of the river\u2019s many bold female bears. National Parks Service and Explore.org Bear 128, called \"Grazer,\" is often one of the fattest bears to visit the Brooks River and this year, she returned with two young cubs. She\u2019s known as a defensive mama bear, often picking fights with much larger bears, including dominant adult males, to keep her cubs safe. Grazer\u2019s boldness is risky but pays off with access to the best fishing spots in the river. 435 \u201cHolly\u201d The experienced mama bear earned the 2019 title for her girthy glow-up. National Parks Service and Explore.org Holly might start the season looking a little scraggly, but by early fall, this sturdy gal resembles \u201cthe shape and color of a toasted marshmallow,\u201d according to Explore.org. The 2019 Fat Bear Week champion is the super-mom of the river. In 2014, Holly adopted an abandoned cub and raised it alongside her biological cub. Both of the cubs are now successful adults, 503 and 719. When Holly earned her heavyweight title in 2019, \"it was very hard to get a good picture [of Holly] out of the water,\" Boak to NPR\u2019s Tom Goldman, \"because she was a submarine for the entire month. She did not stop fishing, except to dig a belly hole big enough for her to sleep in.\" 480 \u201cOtis\u201d Despite missing a few teeth, Otis is still a skilled angler. National Parks Service and Explore.org Another strong contender this year, Otis, has won the competition three times. At around 25 years old, he\u2019s one of the older bears in the bracket\u2014but he's a total fan favorite. Otis made an unusually late appearance at the river this year, but rapidly packed on the pounds when he arrived. \"He's certainly made up for lost time,\" says Mike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger and currently a resident naturalist for Explore.org, to Mashable. \"He's gained an incredible amount of body mass in about seven weeks.\" 32 \u201cChunk\u201d With a name like \u201cChunk,\u201d he\u2019s got a lot to live up to. a href=\"https:\/\/explore.org\/fat-bear-week\"> National Parks Service and Explore.org Even at his leanest, bear 32\u2014\"Chunk\"\u2014is known for maintaining substantial fat reserves, especially on his hindquarters.

The lions and tigers are behaving, eating and drinking normally, according to a National Zoo statement. This week, several species susceptible to contracting the coronavirus received animal-specific vaccines, including all seven orangutans, one western lowland gorilla, one white-eared titi monkey and two emperor tamarins received shots. The big cats will be vaccinated 90 days after they were first infected with the virus.When big cats started coughing and sneezing, staff at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., became concerned. Testing showed their worst fears were true: presumptive positive results for the virus that causes Covid-19. Final results of testing are expected in the next few days. Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers are now being treated for the virus. The sick cats are receiving antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication. In addition to respiratory distress, the animals are also showing signs of lethargy and reduced weight from decreased appetites, according to National Zoo statement. Zoo officials say the public is not at risk of contracting Covid-19 from the big cats \u201cgiven the substantial distance between the animals and visitors,\u201d reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post. No other animals at the National Zoo are \u201cshowing any signs of infection,\u201d the article also states. Just how the lions and tigers contracted the virus is unknown. The zoo\u2019s existing Covid-19 protocols restrict behind-the-scenes access in all animal areas and require staff to use personal protective equipment while maintaining hygiene, cleaning, self-screening and health management. Safety and response protocols are being strictly followed, zoo officials state. \u201cWhile it is possible the infection was transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, it has been standard practice for all animal care staff and essential staff to mask indoors in all public and non-public areas,\u201d the National Zoo statement says. \u201cThe health and vaccination status of employees is confidential medical information.\u201d Animals at a number of zoos across the country have become ill with the Covid-19 virus.

This amount is comparable to 650,000 people not using plastic for a year, Bill Chappell reports for NPR. \"With this transition for our toys, we're working closely with suppliers, families, and play experts and engineers to introduce more sustainable, innovative designs and help drive demand for recycled materials, to keep McDonald's communities and beyond smiling for generations to come,\" Jenny McColloch, the Chief Sustainability Officer for McDonald's, said in a statement. New sustainable toys will feature buildable 3-D paper figures and other toys made from plant-derived materials or recycled plastic, reports Insider's Cheryl Teh. The change to more eco-friendly toys is already underway in some countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. In France, kids can choose between receiving a sustainable toy or a book in the \"One Book or One Toy\" program with their Happy Meal, report Deema Zein and Julia Griffin for PBS News Hour. However, some experts say that while reducing the number of plastic toys is the first step, the fast-food giant is only scratching the surface. \"Given that McDonald's is one of the world's largest franchising brands, more can be done in terms of other operations, like reducing their carbon footprint while moving products across supply chains,\" Sharon Seah, a climate change expert at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told Insider. Seah explained to Insider that McDonald's could offer more vegan or plant-based options on their menu to reduce beef consumption. Other fast-food chains, like Burger King and Qdoba, already offer plant-based meat options like the Impossible Whopper and other Impossible-brand meat options for burritos and tacos, Erica Chayes Wida reports for Today. McDonald's sells more than a billion pounds of beef in the United States alone, per Insider. In 2018, cattle, sheep, and goat farming produced 178 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, per the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems. Aside from switching out plastic toys for cardboard ones, McDonald's aims to reduce their packaging waste. By 2025, McDonald's plans to obtain 100 percent of its guest packaging from recycled sources and recycle the packaging in all its restaurants, NPR reports. Currently, the company has reached 80 percent of this goal. \"By reducing conventional virgin plastic inputs by a projected 90 percent, the re-imagined toys will reduce the demand on fossil fuel plastic production to instead create new markets for responsibly-sourced renewable and recycled content,\" said Sheila Bonini, the Senior Vice President at World Wildlife Fund, in a McDonald's statement. \"And through its immense reach of these toys, McDonald's can engage its millions of daily customers around the world in the transition to a more sustainable, circular future.\" Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

(Pictured: A zebra stands in a field of yellow flowers in Namibia.) Westend61 via Getty Images Editor's Note, October 15, 2021: Prince George County officials publicly announced one of the rogue zebras was found dead at a private residence on September 16 after getting caught in a small animal snare, the Washington Post reports. Initially, officials had reported five zebras missing, when in fact only three had escaped. Now, only two remain at large. The zebras first escaped on August 30 from an 80-acre farm off Duley Station Road in Upper Marlboro. Imagine looking out into your backyard and seeing zebras: It sounds like something out of a dream or a trippy song from the 1970s. But for the past month, it\u2019s been reality for residents of suburban Maryland. It all started on August 31, when five of the striped mammals escaped from a private farm in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, reports Michael Levenson of the New York Times. \u201cWhen I first heard about it I was like, \u2018OK, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me, right? Zebras?\u2019\u201d Rodney Taylor, chief of the Prince George\u2019s County Animal Services Division, told Levenson. In four decades of catching runaway animals, this would be his first experience going after the equine species. As it turns out, catching zebras is a pretty tricky endeavor. Having evolved to escape predators such as lions on the flat savannah and grasslands of Africa, zebras can run very fast at a moment\u2019s notice. Because of the animal's instinct to flee, animal control officials avoid chasing the animals and instead try to lure them into a corral with enticing snacks of grain. They haven\u2019t had any luck, yet, however.-Today August (6) asks me to go fishing before sunset. On the way home he calmly says \u201cdad I saw the zebras\u201d-Something tells me he actually thinks he saw them. So I do a U on Croom Road, pull into some guy\u2019s driveway and\u2026BAM. WILD MARYLAND ZEBRAS @fox5dc @Robert7News pic.twitter.com\/uISFfuPOpS\u2014 Joshua DuBois (@joshuadubois) September 20, 2021 In the meantime, Maryland residents have taken to social media to share their encounters with the animals on the lam, reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post. People have been having fun encountering the animals, with plenty of backyard sightings posted to social media, parents taking their kids zebra hunting, and a nighttime spotting of a zebra crossing the road. (And no, that is not the start of a joke.) Washington, D.C.\u2019s delegate to Congress even released a satirical statement denying responsibility for helping the zebras escape. In the meantime, however, some have started to wonder how a private farm got zebras in the first place. Like many other exotic animals, it turns out that the mammals were legal to own with a permit from the United States Department of Agriculture, per the Post. The owner of these zebras\u2019 former home in fact owns a 39-strong zeal, which is the name for a group of zebras. Another concern at the front of people's minds: what could happen if the zebras are never caught? Could they survive a North American winter? The likely answer is yes, reports Rachel Kurzius of DCist. Some zebras in Africa have been known to live on the high slopes of Mount Kenya, and others have been able to migrate to warmer climates when the temperature drops. \u201cAs with most equids, they have a winter coat. It\u2019ll thicken and keep them warm,\u201d zoologist David Rubenstein of Princeton University told Kurzius. \u201cThey have a high metabolism and as long as they have enough food, that\u2019ll serve as fuel and generate heat to keep them warm.\u201d With plentiful supplies of grass in Maryland and no natural predators, the zebras should be able to survive just fine on their own for as long as they remain free. And as animals prone to running from danger, they most likely shouldn\u2019t present any danger to people who stumble across them. That said, scientists warned folks to keep their distance. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to chase you down,\u201d Taylor told the Post. \u201cBut they are zebras, so they\u2019re not handled by people a lot, so to defend themselves they could bite.\u201d Ben Panko | READ MORE Ben Panko is a staff writer for Smithsonian.com Post a Comment","15":"Low-dose aspirin or baby aspirin (81 to 100 milligrams) has been used as a safe and cheap way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. Aspirin does this by thinning out the blood and preventing blood clots from forming, which may block arteries. Getty images The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) released a draft guideline on October 12 stating that a daily regimen of low-dose aspirin is no longer recommended as a preventative measure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems in older adults without heart disease, reports Lindsey Tanner for the Associated Press. Individuals over 60 should not take preventive aspirin because of the age-related risk for life-threatening bleeding. The guidelines are not yet final but may affect tens of millions of adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, reports Roni Caryn Rabin for the New York Times. Ultimately, those currently on a low-dose aspirin regimen or who have cardiovascular risk factors should talk to their doctors about what is best for them. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend anyone stop without talking to a clinician, and definitely not if they have already had a heart attack or stroke,\u201d says Chien-Wen Tseng, a USPTF member and a University of Hawaii research director, to the New York Times. The report also states that those aged between 40 and 60 and worried about their heart health should decide to take aspirin on a case-by-case basis, reports Ed Cara for Gizmodo. The panel consists of 16 medicine and disease prevention experts who evaluate evidence-based preventative measures and screening tests. Panel members are appointed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Low-dose aspirin or baby aspirin (81 to 100 milligrams) has previously been recommended as a safe and cheap way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. Aspirin does this by thinning out the blood and preventing blood clots from forming, per the New York Times. The drug seems to most help individuals who already have, or are at a high risk for, cardiovascular disease. The panel found some evidence that baby aspirin may only benefit people between 40 and 60 years of age who have a 10 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke, per the Associated Press. However, aspirin can also cause life-threatening bleeding in the digestive tract or brain, per the New York Times. One study published in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of bleeding from an aspirin regimen outweighs its potential benefits for those over 70 years of age, Gizmodo reports. The USPTF made their assessments based on a literature review of data from recent trials and population studies. For older people who have no risks of heart disease, the potential for bleeding damage outweighs any aspirin benefits. \u201cWhen we looked at the literature, most of it suggested the net balance is not favorable for most people \u2014 there was more bleeding than heart attacks prevented,\u201d says Amit Khera, an author of the guideline, to the New York Times. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t nose bleeds, this can be bleeding in the brain.\u201d The draft recommendation statement is currently open for public comment until November 8, before a final version of the report Is published, the New York Times reports. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a blanket statement that everybody who\u2019s at increased risk for heart disease, even though they never had a heart attack, should be on aspirin,\u201d Tseng explains to the New York Times. \u201cWe need to be smarter at matching primary prevention to the people who will benefit the most and have the least risk of harm.\u201d Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute Cheetahs Rosalie and Nick are excited to announce the birth of quintuplets. The proud parents welcomed five healthy cheetah cubs on October 12 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia, reports Jane Recker of the Washingtonian. The spotted spawn were born within a span of six hours\u20145:20, 8:24, 9:42, 10:33 and 11:17 a.m. ET. Rosalie, the five-year-old mother, can be seen caring for her bountiful brood on a live streaming webcam provided by Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute. \u201cSeeing Rosalie successfully care for this litter\u2014her first\u2014with confidence is very rewarding,\u201d Adrienne Crosier, SCBI\u2019s cheetah reproductive biologist, says in a statement. \u201cBeing able to witness the first moments of a cheetah\u2019s life is incredibly special. As webcam viewers watch our cheetah family grow, play and explore their surroundings, we hope the experience brings them joy and helps them feel a deeper connection to this vulnerable species.\u201d With less than 7,500 cheetahs in the wild, the species has been labeled \u201cvulnerable to extinction\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Cheetahs live in small, isolated populations mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where their numbers are being decimated by human conflict, poaching, and habitat and prey-base loss, according to the SCBI statement. Since 2007, 16 litters of cheetah cubs have been born at SCBI, including a family of four in 2020. In September, SCBI staff took over care of a day-old cub that was abandoned by its mother due to lack of milk stimulation. The baby was bottle-fed by hand for 17 days until it could be sent to an adoptive mother cheetah at a breeding facility in Oregon, where it is now thriving. SCBI is part of the Cheetah Breeding Center Coalition\u2014a group of ten breeding centers across the United States that maintain a sustainable North American cheetah population under human care, reports the Washingtonian. Crosier coordinates the effort through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 Cheetah Species Survival Plan, which she heads. SCBI spearheads research programs at its headquarters in Virginia, National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and field research stations and training sites worldwide. Scientists at the facility tackle complex conservation challenges by applying knowledge of animal behavior and reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration and conservation sustainability, the SCBI statement says. Mom and her babies can be viewed on the cheetah cam until the cubs leave the den. The new family has access to other areas at the facility, so it is possible they may be off-camera if they go out and explore. Genders of the cute cubs are not known at this time since SCBI keepers have not been able to examine the brood in person yet. Rosalie is doing well, though is understandably tired after giving birth to the five cheetah cherubs. The father, ten-year-old Nick was the first cheetah ever born at SCBI.

NurPhoto via Getty Images Earlier this week pharmaceutical company Merck announced it has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use of what could be the first-ever pill to treat Covid-19. Because the antiviral drug can be delivered in series of convenient and relatively inexpensive capsules, some experts say it could be a game-changer in the fight against the virus. If the pill is approved by the FDA\u2014which could happen in a matter of weeks\u2014millions of Americans could be eligible to receive it. All other approved Covid-19 treatments must be delivered intravenously or injected by a medical professional, while the capsule could be taken at home as soon as symptoms appear. The pill, which contains the antiviral drug molnupiravir, won\u2019t be a fix-all for the pandemic, but it will provide public health experts with another tool in their arsenal. Experts say vaccinations are the best way to protect oneself from infection, but the new antiviral medication provides a better shot for those that do fall ill. Around 68 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, underscoring the need for safe and effective treatments for Covid-19 infections. \u201cThe value here is that it\u2019s a pill so you don\u2019t have to deal with the infusion centers and all the factors around that,\u201d says Nicholas Kartsonis, a senior vice president with Merck\u2019s infectious disease unit, to Matthew Perrone of the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful tool to add to the toolbox.\u201d The drug molnupiravir, which was first tested for influenza, works by interfering with the way SARS-CoV-2 replicates inside our cells, causing mutations that kill the virus. In the company\u2019s clinical trials, they reported that the pill halved hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated adults infected with Covid-19. The study group included adults who were already showing symptoms and were at a high risk of severe disease. The company says it\u2019s seeking authorization for its pill to be given only to high-risk adults, like those over 60 or with other risk factors like obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. The results are not peer-reviewed, and the FDA will examine Merck\u2019s studies on the drug before making a decision, reports Cassandra Willyard for Nature. Eventually, the FDA could approve the drug for lower-risk Americans, too. The medication isn\u2019t a one-and-done pill: the company says people will have to take four pills twice a day for five days, for a total of 40 capsules. Merck, which is developing the pill with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, anticipates producing enough pills for 10 million people by the end of this year. A similar antiviral pill being developed by Pfizer and Atea Pharmaceuticals-Roche, reports Rebecca Robbins for the New York Times. The new medication could also provide relief to over-burdened hospitals, especially in places where vaccination rates are still low. The pills cost about a third of the price of intravenous monoclonal antibody treatments with a price tag of around $700 USD per patient, but that may still be too costly for some nations. \u201cAre we going to be in a situation where the price is reasonable in low- and middle-income countries?\u201d says Rachel Cohen, the North American executive director at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, to Nature. If those countries are able to get a supply of molnupiravir, they often lack the recourses needed to spot infections early. Because Merck\u2019s pill must be taken within the first five days of showing symptoms, \u201cthat requires that we are able to actually rapidly diagnose people,\u201d Cohen says, which \u201cis actually a huge challenge.\u201d Because clinical trials included only high-risk, unvaccinated people, it\u2019s not clear if the pill will be available to vaccinated people. A company spokeswoman said it would be up to the FDA to decide, according to the New York Times. Because of the way the drug works to kill the virus, people who are pregnant will not be eligible to receive the pills due to the risk of birth defects.

Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images The drought facing much of the American West is hurting the region\u2019s ability to generate electricity by throttling the water flowing through hydroelectric power plants, reports Michael Phillis for the Associated Press. A new report from the Energy Information Administration projects that because of the severe drought, hydropower generation will decline by nearly 14 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. California had to shut down Oroville Lake\u2019s Hyatt Power Plant in August when water levels dropped too low. At Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the Utah-Arizona border, water levels have plunged so low that the United States Bureau of Reclamation projects that the lake may no longer have enough water to generate electricity by 2023 if drought conditions persist, reports Dan Gearino for Inside Climate News. Losing Lake Powell\u2019s Glen Canyon Dam would require utility companies to find a new way to get electricity to the 5.8 million customers the dam currently supplies with power. Hydropower generation produces 7.3 percent of U.S. electricity. When that power supply falls short, states are likely to make up the difference by burning fossil fuels that exacerbate climate change, per Inside Climate. For example, California\u2019s hydropower has declined 38 percent compared to 2020 and in response, the state is expected to boost natural gas power by 7 percent, the AP reports. In the Pacific Northwest, the hydropower shortfall is predicted to increase coal power generation by 12 percent. Given all this, Inside Climate\u2019s Gearino poses the question of whether this means hydropower is becoming a less reliable power source as the U.S. tries to transition to using more renewable energy. Unsatisfyingly, the answer appears to be that we don\u2019t yet know. While temperatures are assuredly rising, the climate change\u2013driven changes in precipitation will vary significantly by region. But when severe drought and extreme heat collide, as they have this year, states like California that rely heavily on hydropower can be forced to buy extra power to meet demand, which tends to spike when temperatures soar, per the AP. Still, this year\u2019s drop in hydropower generation is not without precedent. Per Inside Climate, 2007 saw a 14.4 percent drop and in 2012 hydropower generation fell by 13.5 percent. But the fluctuations highlight the ways in which the extremes brought about by climate change are stressing human infrastructure and creating added challenges when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels.

The revelation that these sales were taking place on Facebook came as a result of a BBC News investigation published in February. BBC News found plots of the Brazilian Amazon were being sold via the social media platform\u2019s classified ads and many of those lands were protected and included national forest as well as tracts reserved for the region\u2019s Indigenous peoples. Facebook initially stated it was \u201cready to work with local authorities\u201d without indicating it would take matters into its own hands. The tech company announced its new policy aimed at addressing the illegal sales in a blog post last Friday. \u201cToday, we are announcing measures to curb attempts to sell land in ecological conservation areas within the Amazon rainforest on Facebook Marketplace,\u201d the company wrote in the post. \u201cWe are updating our commerce policies to explicitly prohibit the buying or selling of land of any type in ecological conservation areas on our commerce products across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d The policy update involves reviewing listings that appear in Facebook Marketplace by comparing them to an international database of protected areas maintained by the United Nations Environment Program\u2019s World Conservation Monitoring Center, per BBC News. Facebook\u2019s move comes as threats to the Brazilian Amazon from logging and land clearing only appear to be growing. Deforestation in the country\u2019s rainforests, which comprise 60 percent of the Amazon, is at a 12-year high, and recent reporting from Reuters says satellite data suggests September saw a slight increase in deforestation compared to last year, with about 280 square miles of forest being slashed or burned. Meanwhile, the social media giant has fallen under heavy criticism following leaked research, whistleblower testimony and a major outage, per the Verge\u2019s Ian Carlos Campbell. Some called into question whether Facebook\u2019s new policy would be an effective tool in curbing the sale of protected lands. Brenda Brito, a Brazilian lawyer and Stanford environmental scientist, tells BBC News that Facebook doesn\u2019t require sellers to provide the exact location of the land they\u2019re selling. \"If they don't make it mandatory for sellers to provide the location of the area on sale, any attempt at blocking them will be flawed,\u201d says Brito.

D. DUKE ET AL\/NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOR 2021 Within the mudflats of the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah, archeologists uncovered four 12,300-year-old charred tobacco seeds in an ancient hearth once used by hunter-gatherers near the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, reports Charles Q. Choi for Live Science. The find suggests that humans' use of tobacco began 9,000 years earlier than previously thought. Before the discovery, the earliest known evidence of human tobacco use was 3,000-year-old ceramic pipes from Alabama that contained nicotine residue, per Live Science. The study published this month in Nature Human Behaviour could reveal a new timeline of human's use of intoxicants and how it may have led to food crop domestication. \"We now know that Indigenous peoples in the Americas have been using tobacco for much of time since they arrived,\" says study author Daron Duke, an archeologist at Far Western Anthropological Research Group in Nevada, to Inverse's Tara Yarlagadda. Tobacco is so intertwined with human history that it has had the most impact socially and economically out of all the intoxicants humans use. From the ancient Maya to Indigenous peoples living in what is now the United States, tobacco is considered sacred and has been used for ceremonial or medicinal purposes, per Live Science. When Europeans colonized the Americas, the leafy plant drove the American colonial economy and Western expansion across North America. The earliest evidence of the plant's domestication dates to about 8,000 years ago in South America, reports Bruce Bower for Science News. However, how tobacco came to North America is still debated. Some researchers argue that tobacco may have already existed in North America before humans arrived, or it was brought there from South and Central America by migrating humans, per Inverse. The scorched tobacco seeds\u2014unearthed in 2015\u2014most likely came from plants taken from foothills or mountains near the Wishbone hearth archeological site. The fireplace where scientists discovered the seeds was also riddled with more than 2,000 bone fragments, some stone artifacts like spear tips used to hunt large animals, and charred willow wood that was most likely used as firewood. Researchers used the charred wood to carbon date the tobacco seeds to about 12,300 years old, Inverse reports. Most of the bone fragments belonged to ducks, per Live Science. Before the area was the desert terrain we know of today, it was a marshland filled with waterfowl and wetland plants, per Science News. While the seeds do not indicate how the ancient humans used tobacco, researchers suspect that tobacco leaves, stems, and other plants may have been twisted together and chewed or sucked and the seeds were discarded or spit out, per Science News. Ancestral Puebloans in what is now Arizona chewed tobacco 1,000 to 2,000 years ago. Whether or not ancient humans smoked the tobacco at the Wishbone archeological site is yet to be determined, Science News reports. However, the find does suggest that tobacco has deep cultural roots dating back thousands of years. Duke and his team plan on searching for more archeological sites like the Wishbone hearth to further pinpoint a timeline for tobacco use and shed light on cultural forces behind its cultivation. \"People in the past were the ultimate botanists and identified the intoxicant values of tobacco quickly upon arriving in the Americas,\" Duke tells Live Science. \"We have been working to get Indigenous input about the meaning and importance of the find. This will not only help us understand the find for the common scientific reasons, but also help us learn more about its values to the people whose forebears camped at the site and lived throughout the region.\" Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Photo by Lev Radin\/Pacific Press\/LightRocket via Getty Images In the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, medical professionals were puzzled by an unusual symptom cropping up in some of their patients: red, frostbite-like sores on their toes. The condition informally called \"Covid toes\" was appearing in teenagers and young adults who were testing negative for the virus, but had other coronavirus-like symptoms, including loss of taste and smell. A new study suggests that the toe lesions may be a side effect of the immune system\u2019s aggressive defensive response to the Covid-19 virus, which can damage cells and tissues in the process. The sores, which can cause an itching or burning sensation, were \"extremely painful and many patients couldn't sleep or walk,\" says Charles Cassius, lead author on the study and a researcher at France\u2019s H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, to Insider\u2019s Marianne Guenot. \"During the first wave of the pandemic...patients with Covid toe were afraid they were developing severe COVID-19 and that they could transmit it,\" he says. When patients started arriving in hospitals with these mysterious toe lesions, doctors debated if it was linked to Covid-19. Some dermatologists suggested that the sores were caused by inflammation, while others thought they might result from small blood clots, reports Nicoletta Lanese for Live Science. The blistered, swollen, and itchy skin\u2014called chilblains\u2014can also appear on some peoples\u2019 fingers. The lesions appear red or purple in people with light skin tones, and often purplish or brownish in people with dark skin tones, reports Roni Caryn Rabin for the New York Times. A teenage patient's foot as pictured in April 2020 showing \u201cCovid toes.\u201d Photo courtesy of Amy Paller, Northwestern University In the study, published by French researchers in the British Journal of Dermatology last week, they analyzed blood samples and skin biopsies from 50 patients sent to the hospital in April 2020. When they examined the blood samples, the team found evidence that two parts of the immune system may be behind the lesions. Patients with chilblains had high levels of a type 1 interferon, a protein that kicks the immune response in gear but can also damage the body. The team also found elevated levels of an antibody that can turn on the body\u2019s own cells. Lastly, they discovered that the frostbite-like sores may be due to changes in the lining of blood vessels, which could cause damage in parts of the body where vessels are most narrow, like toes and fingers. Like a biological wreaking ball, an aggressive immune response can successfully ward off viruses but also damage healthy cells in the process. For each of the patients in the study, it was the first time they\u2019d developed chilblains. Though more than half of the patients studied had symptoms consistent with Covid-19, like shortness of breath and loss of taste and smell, all of them tested negative for the virus. Although the relationship between being infected with Covid-19 and \"Covid toes\" is still being debated, the authors conclude that \"peaks of chilblainlike lesions [accompanying] peaks of Covid-19 deaths in 2020 strongly suggest that this disorder is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\" Their work will help guide medical care for patients with \"Covid toes,\" who can easily treat their lesions with anti-in\ufb02ammatory medication. The findings of the recent study echo a small study done earlier this year, according to the New York Times. The study, which only three male patients, also suggested that the bizarre toe and finger rashes were linked to a strong immune response. Cases of \"Covid toes\" seemed to peak during the first waves of the pandemic, and have become less common during the rise of the Delta variant says dermatologist Veronique Bataille to the BBC's Michelle Roberts.

However, third doses are currently authorized for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions, or those 65 years of age or older. Marko Geber\/Getty Images According to a clinical trial led by researchers at the University of Bristol, individuals can receive a flu shot and their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine simultaneously, Carl Zimmer reports for the New York Times. The preliminary results were released as a pre-print study in The Lancet in September and have not yet been peer-reviewed. Covid-19 booster vaccines are also safe to receive alongside the flu vaccine. However, at this time, third doses are only authorized for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions, or those 65 years of age or older, reports Kaitlin Sullivan of NBC News. In the new study's trials, doctors recruited 679 volunteers from April to June at 12 sites in Britain. During the study, all volunteers had received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca, per the New York Times. Half of the participants received a flu shot when the groups returned for their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while the other half received a placebo. The vaccines were given on the same day, but administered in different arms. The researchers found that 97 percent of participants were willing to receive two jabs at future appointments. After receiving their doses of the vaccines, the research team monitored the study groups for fevers or aches. Side effects were mild to moderate in trials with three types of flu vaccines, per Alistair Smout for Reuters. \"This is a really positive step which could mean fewer appointments for those who require both vaccines,\" says the study's first author Rajeka Lazarus, a vaccinologist at the University Hospital Bristol & Weston, to Reuters. Blood samples from the participants show that various combinations of flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines given simultaneously do not change either shot's effectiveness compared to receiving each jab separately, reports the New York Times. Previously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended spacing out Covid-19 and flu vaccines by 14 days. But the CDC has revised its guidelines and suggests the wait is no longer needed, reports Emma H. Tobin for the Associated Press. Experts generally recommend staying up to date on vaccines this year because last year's flu season was historically mild since people were staying home and masking up. However, as mask mandates have been lifted and the vaccines have allowed people to return to in-person gatherings, there is no way to tell how intense this year's flu will be, per the AP. \"The worry is that if they both circulate at the same time, we're going to have this sort of 'twin-demic,'\" Richard Webby, a flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, tells the AP. \"The concern with that is that it's going to put extra strain on an already strained health care system.\" Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Marco Verch via Flickr [CC BY 2.0] Though there are is an increasing number of women represented in research, the recent round of Nobel Prize winners has highlighted the persistent gender discrepancies in the highest tiers of science. The prestigious awards have come under fire for their exclusion of female recipients in the past, and this year\u2019s all-male lineup for medicine, physics, and chemistry prizes has reignited criticism. Women have been woefully underrepresented among the list of Nobel winners since the awards began over a century ago\u2014and especially so in science. The Nobel Prizes, named after Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, are awarded in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace, and as of 1968, economic sciences. Though there is only one prize awarded in each category, the honor can go to a maximum of three individuals, based on the rules set by Alfred Nobel. Since the earliest days of the awards, Nobel recipients are overwhelmingly white, male, and American. Of all 972 Nobel recipients, only 58 women have won the prize. The 118 literature awardees include 16 women, and 17 of the 135 peace prize recipients are women. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to 12 women out of the 224 total winners, and the Chemistry Prize includes 7 women of the 188 total laureates. Of the 219 laureates to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics since 1901, just four have been women. Not including this year\u2019s STEM awardees\u2014all of whom were men\u2014women account for three percent of science category winners, but they were almost always awarded jointly with male peers. Credit: Felix Richter viaStatista by [CC BY-ND 2.0] The 2020 Nobels were a comparatively good year for female laureates, who accounted for four of the 11 recipients. When the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to female scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna, it was the first time that a science award had been given solely to a pair of women since the Nobels began in 1901. The other two prize recipients, poet Louise Gl\u00fcck for literature and astrophysicist Andrea M. Ghez for physics, were just the sixteenth and fourth female winners of their categories, respectively. When women are awarded a Nobel alongside men, they\u2019re likely to get a smaller slice of the prize money as well. The gap is more severe for people of color: just 16 of the 972 people and organizations who have received Nobels are Black. Never in the Nobel\u2019s 120-year-history has a Black person of any gender been awarded a prize in a science category. The few women who have managed to secure Nobels in science categories have overcome barriers and sigma in their fields to make some of the most influential discoveries of the past century. The first woman to received a Nobel, Marie Curie, was awarded the physics prize with her husband in 1903 for their study of spontaneous radiation. In 1911, Curie was the sole winner of the chemistry prize for her pioneering work on radioactivity. Only two other women, geneticist Barbara McClintock and chemist Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, have been sole prize-winners. In 2018, Donna Strickland won the Physics prize alongside two men to become the third woman ever to revive the honor.Following the @NobelPrize announcements?Since its establishment in 1895, the #NobelPrize has been awarded to less than 60 women.Unfortunately, the underrepresentation of women Nobel laureates over the years is just another indicator of the slow progress on gender equality. pic.twitter.com\/IAtZUJ5Qul\u2014 UN Women (@UN_Women) October 5, 2021 When asked how she felt about being part of an exclusive group of women Strickland said, \u201cReally? Is that all? I thought there might have been more,\u201d to Sarah Kaplan at the Washington Post. \u201cObviously, we need to celebrate women physicists, because we\u2019re out there. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m honored to be one of those women.\u201d Because women have historically occupied fewer positions in academia than men have, one might expect to see fewer female winners. According to the United States Census Bureau, women made up 8 percent of STEM workers in 1970 versus 27 percent in 2019. While women are better-represented in science careers today than a few decades ago, they still face persistent career challenges, receive lower pay, and are awarded fewer prizes than their male peers. A study published earlier this year analyzed 141 of the top science prizes awarded over the past two decades and found that women are far less likely to win major awards than their male peers regardless of the quantity and quality of their research. In addition to systemic racial and economic barriers that make it more challenging for women and people of color to thrive in STEM fields, a lack of representation in Nobels reaffirms the narrow idea of who scientists are and what they look like. After another year of white male science winners, some are calling on the Nobel committee to increase the diversity of their members and the transparency of their selection system.

Minet et al. 2021 When they first saw the Madagascar star orchid with its extremely long nectar tubes in the 1860s, evolutionary scientists Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace they each marvelled at what being could possibly reach its sweet nectar. Both suggested only a creature with particularly prodigious tongue could access the plant\u2019s syrup. In a letter to friends, Darwin exclaimed, \u201cGood heavens, what insect can suck it!\u201d reports Beth Askham in an article for the Natural History Museum (NHM) of London. \u201cThat such a moth exists in Madagascar may be safely predicted,\u201d Wallace later added. A Madagascar star orchid with its extremely long nectar tube. New York Botanical Garden They were right. Scientists first discovered a Madagascan moth with a tongue length of more than 11 inches in 1903. At the time, it was considered a subspecies of Morgan\u2019s sphinx moth, a hawkmoth also found on the African mainland. Now, thanks to DNA sampling, researchers report this insect is actually a separate species, according to a study published in the journal Antenor. Known as Wallace\u2019s sphinx moth, the bug is distinctly different from the Morgan variety, which is smaller and has a tongue only about a quarter as long as the Madagascar moth, reports David Schultz of Science magazine. \u201cThe taxonomic change we now propose finally gives long-deserved recognition, at the species level, to one of the most celebrated of all Malagasy endemics,\u201d study author David Lees, NHM curator of moths, says in a statement. He is also the co-author of Moths: A Complete Guide to Biology and Behavior, published by Smithsonian Books. Moths: A Complete Guide to Biology and Behavior Accessible introduction to the biology, life cycle, natural history, and classification of moths Buy Lees and Jo\u00ebl Minet, an entomologist at the Institut de Syst\u00e9matique, \u00c9volution, Biodiversit\u00e9 in Paris, led the research that identified a 7.6 percent genetic difference in DNA barcoding between the two species of hawkmoths, also known as hummingbird moths, which are part of the Xanthopan genus. \u201cThis is much more than what you would expect between different species,\u201d Lees says in the NHM statement. The scientists also detected 25 physical differences between the Madagascan and African moths, reports Fermin Koop of ZME Science. For one, the tongue of Wallace\u2019s sphinx moth can reach nearly a foot in length while the probiscis of Morgan\u2019s sphinx moth\u2014known scientifically as Xanthopan morganii\u2014is less than three inches. Also, the former is nearly twice as large as the latter. \u201cThe underside of the hawkmoth from Madagascar is pinkish, while the underside of the hawkmoth from Africa is whitish or yellowish,\u201d Lees says in the statement. These morphological distinctions add up to conclusive proof that the two moths are separate species. The DNA testing also determined that Wallace\u2019s sphinx moths on Madagascar all shared the same genome, strongly supporting the hypothesis for a new species, now named Xanthopan praedicta. \u201cThe fact that I found one of these moths in a remote forest in the southwest of Madagascar suggests it can fly hundreds of kilometers,\u201d Lees says in the NHA statement.

VTT Photo In the not-too-distant future, your morning jolt of joe might be made in a bioreactor. A team of Finnish scientists has created coffee in the lab from cell cultures that both smell and taste like the real deal. Using a bioreactor designed for cellular agriculture, researchers at Technical Research Center (VTT) in Finland\u2014a country that consumes the most coffee per capita in the world\u2014brewed a batch from cultured cells derived from the leaves of coffee plants for the first time, writes Heiko Rischer, the project's lead researcher, in a VTT statement. \u201cIn terms of smell and taste, our trained sensory panel and analytical examination found the profile of the brew to bear similarity to ordinary coffee,\u201d Rischer tells Gaynor Selby of Food Ingredients First. \u201cHowever, coffee making is an art and involves iterative optimization under the supervision of specialists with dedicated equipment. Our work marks the basis for such work.\u201d This development bodes well for the planet and the coffee industry, both of which are reeling from the strain of a high-octane obsession with the beverage\u2014the third-most consumed drink in the world, behind tea and water. Coffee growers are finding it difficult to keep up with current global demand\u2014about 22 billion pounds are produced each year\u2014which places more strain on the climate due to deforestation to make way increased agriculture. Researcher Elviira Kaerkkaeinen brews a batch of coffee from leaves cultured in a bioreactor in Finland. VTT Photo \u201cConventional coffee production is notoriously associated with several problematic issues, such as unsustainable farming methods, exploitation and land rights,\u201d Rischer tells Flora Southey of Food Navigator. \u201cGrowing demand and climate change add to the problems.\u201d Researchers state this innovation will help make coffee production more sustainable by eliminating the need for expanded agriculture. \u201cThe idea is to use biotechnology rather than conventional farming for the production of food and therefore provide alternative routes which are less dependent on unsustainable practices,\u201d Rischer tells Nick Lavars of New Atlas. \u201cFor example, these solutions have a lower water footprint and less transport is needed due to local production. There isn\u2019t any seasonal dependency or the need for pesticides either.\u201d Rischer and his team employed the same technique used to make other agricultural products\u2014including meat, dairy and egg\u2014in the lab. They cultured coffee cells and got them to grow in media, then dried and roasted the results before testing it for taste and smell. \u201cThe experience of drinking the very first cup was exciting,\u201d Rischer says in the VTT statement. \u201cI estimate we are only four years away from ramping up production and having regulatory approval in place. Growing plant cells requires specific expertise when it is time to scale and optimize the process. Downstream processing and product formulation together with regulatory approval and market introduction are additional steps on the way to a commercial product. That said, we have now proved that lab-grown coffee can be a reality.\u201d To make sure the lab-grown coffee was acceptable to consumers, VTT did a taste test with a sensory panel. The team included several varieties of coffee produced by bioreactor. \u201cMy personal favorite was the dark roast,\u201d Rischer tells Food Ingredients First.

The only question is: can this technique work on a larger scale? It\u2019s easier to potty train calves than children. Who knew? Scientists knew, it turns out. They discovered this while looking for a way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced on farms. By teaching young cows to use the \u201cMooLoo\u201d\u2014a latrine for cattle\u2014the excrement can then be collected and reused for fertilizer while controlling the harmful impact of nitrous oxide in the environment. Surprisingly, the calves took to the training rather easily and quickly, according to Lindsay Matthews, an animal behavioral scientist at the University of Auckland and one of the authors of a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Current Biology. \u201cThe calves\u2019 rate of learning is within the range seen with 2- to 4-year-old children, and faster than for many children,\u201d he tells David Grimm of Science magazine. Matthews adds that it took only 15 days to train the calves. Children, typically, take much longer to potty train. Cattle pee a lot\u2014up to eight gallons a day per cow. That urine contains nitrogen, which turns into ammonia when mixed with feces\u2014an all-too-common problem in the barnyard, reports Hannah Devlin of the Guardian. So researchers wanted to see if they somehow could capture urine from cows to reduce agricultural pollution. The idea of training calves to urinate in a designated pen, says researcher Lindsay Matthews (above), originally came to him when he was speaking with a radio host in 2007. Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology Microbes in the soil convert ammonia into nitrous oxide, which comprises seven percent of all greenhouse gasses in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cattle farms are responsible for half of the ammonia produced in Europe, says study co-author Jan Langbein, an applied ethologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Germany. Studies show that capturing 80 percent of cow urine worldwide would lead to a 56 percent reduction in ammonia emissions, says the Guardian. \u201cVoiding in a specific location (latrine) would help resolve this dilemma by allowing ready capture and treatment of excreta under more spacious farming conditions,\u201d the scientists state in the study. Training the calves to urinate in one place began in jest. In 2007, a radio interviewer joked with Matthews about potty training young cows in order to control ammonia emissions, reports Seth Borenstein of the Associated Press (AP). The idea resonated with the scientist, who started an experiment in 2009, but then funding ran out. A couple of years ago, Matthews and Langbein teamed up with other colleagues to try it again. The team taught 16 Holstein calves to use an enclosed area designed to capture their excrement by rewarding successful urination with a molasses mixture or crushed barley. The experiments were conducted in an indoor facility at FBN. Using diuretics to get the calves to pee, scientists allowed the test subjects to roam about until they felt the urge. When they had to go, 11 pushed into the pen, did their duty and received their reward, reports AP. The next step is to learn how to use the practice for larger herds and convincing farmers of the necessity of doing so. If they buy into potty training cattle, the MooLoo could make it significantly easier to control waste products and reduce greenhouse emissions. \u201cI am not surprised they can train calves to urinate in set locations, but I am surprised no one has demonstrated this before,\u201d Brian Hare, a Duke University animal cognition scientist who wasn\u2019t part of the research, tells AP. \u201cThe critical question is can it and will it scale?\u201d David Kindy | | READ MORE David Kindy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

University of Auckland Necessity may be the mother of invention, but for Bruce the parrot, it is the essence of survival. Despite having a broken beak, the kea from New Zealand has learned to use tools he developed on his own to preen himself. Bruce was found without the upper half of his beak as a juvenile in 2013. He was nursed back to health at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve in Christchurch, where he now resides with a flock of kea, an alpine parrot found only in New Zealand. It is not known how Bruce lost his upper beak, though it is suspected it happened in an animal trap. After his recovery, researchers noticed Bruce was using small pebbles to rid his plumage of mites and dirt\u2014a practice that has never been observed before. Keas traditionally use their beaks to preen themselves. \u201cKea do not regularly display tool use in the wild, so to have an individual innovate tool use in response to his disability shows great flexibility in their intelligence,\u201d study author Amalia Bastos, a Ph.D. student at the University of Auckland School of Psychology, tells Eva Corlett for the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re able to adapt and flexibly solve new problems as they emerge.\u201d Corlett and her fellow researchers studied Bruce for nine days to learn how he developed his self-care technique on his own and published their findings in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports. They observed Bruce selecting specific sizes of pebbles that he could fit in his still-intact lower beak. Using his tongue, the parrot holds the small stone in place to preen his plumage. Other scientists were at first skeptical of the findings, but videos show Bruce continually doing what Bastos and others have claimed. \u201cThe main criticism we received before publication was, \u2018Well, this activity with the pebbles may have been just accidental\u2014you saw him when coincidentally he had a pebble in his mouth,\u2019\u201d Bastos tells Nicholas Bakalar of the New York Times. \u201cBut no. This was repeated many times. He drops the pebble, he goes and picks it up. He wants that pebble. If he\u2019s not preening, he doesn\u2019t pick up a pebble for anything else.\u201d Kea are a highly intelligent species of parrot, the only one existing in alpine regions. The inquisitive bird has been known to peck apart window trim and wiper blades on cars\u2014and even steal passports from tourists. However, none has ever been observed using pebbles to clean themselves. As a control, the researchers also watched other kea at the Willowbank Wildlife Reserve. Although many use sticks and other objects for play, no others were seen using small pebbles for preening. \u201cKea do not regularly display tool use in the wild, so to have an individual innovate tool use in response to his disability shows great flexibility in their intelligence,\" Bastos says in a University of Auckland statement. \"They\u2019re able to adapt and flexibly solve new problems as they emerge.\" At the reserve, Bruce receives soft foods from the staff so he can eat. However, he has also been observed eating harder foods by scraping them against other objects. \u201cHe\u2019ll pick up a piece of carrot and push it against a hard piece of metal or rock and use that to scrape with his lower bill, which again is a feeding behavior we haven\u2019t seen in the other birds,\u201d Bastos tells the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not tool use but it is another interesting way he has adapted to his disability.\u201d David Kindy | | READ MORE David Kindy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

The images, later assembled into a tour-like video, reveal that Curiosity had cruised into a region consisting of salty sulfates that transition into another area enriched with clay minerals. The varying layers on Mount Sharp, located in the Gale Crater, may help researchers uncover how Mars became the arid environment it is today, reports Mike Wall for Space.com. NASA stitched together 129 individual images taken with the rover\u2019s Mast Camera to create 360-degree panoramic vistas that showcase Mars\u2019 landscape history, per Gizmodo\u2019s Alyse Stanley. NASA also color-balanced the photos to display how Mars would look if it had similar light conditions to those on Earth. Since landing on the Red Planet in August 2012, Curiosity has explored the Gale Crater for nine years to see if Mars had the right conditions to support microbial life at some point in its history. The rover has observed sediment patterns that suggest the Gale Crater housed a lake and stream system billions of years ago. In 2014, Curiosity reached the base of Mount Sharp and, since then, has been climbing the five-mile-tall mountain and exploring its rounded hills for clues as to how the lake system dried up, Space.com reports. \u201cThe rocks here will begin to tell us how this once-wet planet changed into the dry Mars of today, and how long habitable environments persisted even after that happened,\u201d says Abigail Fraeman, Curiosity\u2019s deputy project scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in a statement. Sulfates form in drier conditions, so NASA researchers suspect that this area on Mount Sharp may explain how Mars\u2019 climate changed over time, Space.com reports. Around July on Earth, Mars experiences winter, so the planet\u2019s signature red, hazy dust settled enough for Curiosity to snap clear views of the Gale Crater\u2019s floor and the 16-mile trek it took to get to where it is now, Gizmodo reports. Curiosity\u2019s power source was designed to last for a minimum of 14 Earth years, so it has plenty of time to keep exploring Mount Sharp and other areas. Next year, Curiosity will explore other Martian features, like the Rafael Navarro Mountain, and revisit the Greenheugh Pediment, per Gizmodo.

Over time, these clean energy behemoths are being built even larger to generate more power, but what happens to wildlife when blades get broader and towers get taller? It turns out, size really doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to wind turbines. A recent study shows that newer, bigger systems are no more dangerous for bats and birds than older, smaller units. To collect data for this investigation, scientists used conservation dogs. The four-legged researchers were able to locate downed birds and bats at a wind turbine facility in California that included both newer and older systems for comparative purposes, reports Josh Saul in Bloomberg Green. The study, led by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), determined wildlife mortality rates remained the same per unit of energy produced. That is, as long as the electric output was constant, there was no difference between \u201csmaller, lower capacity, closely spaced turbines with larger, higher capacity ones, more widely spaced,\u201d the scientists write in the paper, published in March 2021 in the Journal of Applied Ecology. At one search site, \u201cdogs found 71 bat fatalities in 55 searches compared to 1 bat found by humans in 69 searches,\u201d the study reports. Courtesy of Rogue Detection Teams via USGS \u201cLocation, as well as the amount of energy production, are likely stronger determinants of wildlife deaths than the size of turbines installed,\u201d says study author Manuela Huso, a USGS research statistician, in a press release. \u201cSimply replacing older and smaller wind turbines with newer and larger machines generating the same amount of energy has little effect on the rate of wildlife mortality.\u201d That\u2019s good news for the wind energy industry, which is upgrading from smaller turbines with low capacity to larger units with better performance. The infrastructure plan working its way through Congress is likely to include tax credits for bigger and better renewable energy projects. Of course, that\u2019s good news for bats and birds too. And they can thank dogs for finding it out. Teams of canines and handlers worked at San Gorgonio Pass Wind Resource Area near Palm Springs, California, to help scientists assemble the data. Another study, also focused on wind turbines, found dogs are much more adept at locating remains than humans, thus resulting in more accurate fatality counts. Published in the Journal of Wildlife Management in 2020, the controlled study shows dogs are between 2.7 and 6.4 times better at locating bats and small birds than humans. At one search site, \u201cdogs found 71 bat fatalities in 55 searches compared to 1 bat found by humans in 69 searches,\u201d according to the study. \u201cTruth was, people are terrible at finding bats and small birds,\u201d study author K. Shawn Smallwood, a wildlife biologist who worked at University of California, Davis, tells Sarah Zhang of The Atlantic. At first, Smallwood was doubtful that dogs would make that much of difference. The study results changed his mind. \u201cOf trial carcasses placed and confirmed available before next\u2010day fatality searches, dogs detected 96% of bats and 90% of small birds, whereas humans at a neighboring wind project detected 6% of bats and 30% of small birds,\u201d according to the study. Conservation canines are a great asset to science. In recent years, their talents have been assisted with a growing list of olfactory opportunities. Canines have also helping to sniff out Covid-19 contamination in Massachusetts, invasive mud snails in Wisconsin, illegal game poachers in Africa and even whale poop at sea for scientific research.

Trials in the United Kingdom are now underway to explore the possibility of scaling up biofuel crops like Miscanthus grasses to see if they can help fight climate change by removing carbon from the atmosphere. Bill Allsopp \/ Loop Images \/ Universal Images Group via Getty Images Preventing the world from blowing past the 1.5-degree-Celsius (2.7-degrees-Fahrenheit) threshold identified by the Paris climate agreement is unlikely if reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the only approach taken toward that goal. Hitting this target, aimed at allowing Earth and its inhabitants to avoid the worst effects of human-caused climate change, will almost certainly also require sucking greenhouse gases directly out of the atmosphere and somehow storing them. In the United Kingdom, reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is likely to require pulling an estimated 100 million tons of carbon dioxide out of the sky every year, reports Damian Carrington for the Guardian. To that end, this week the U.K. announced the start of trials for five methods of removing planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to a statement from U.K. Research and Innovation (UKRI). \u201cReducing greenhouse gas emissions is a priority for the U.K., but it\u2019s clear that alone that will not be enough to reduce CO2 and meet the U.K.\u2019s net-zero climate target by 2050,\u201d says Duncan Wingham, executive chair of the Natural Environment Research Council at UKRI, in the statement. \u201cThese projects will investigate how we can actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere using innovative technologies at the scale required to protect our planet.\u201d The country\u2019s new roughly $42 million project is one of the biggest trials of carbon removal in the world, according to the Guardian. The project will explore techniques involving trees, peat, rock chips and charcoal on a 247-acre plot of land. \u201cThis is seriously exciting and pretty much world leading,\u201d Cameron Hepburn, an environmental economist at the University of Oxford who is the lead coordinator of the trials, tells the Guardian. \u201cNobody really wants to be in the situation of having to suck so much CO2 from the atmosphere. But that\u2019s where we are\u2013we\u2019ve delayed [climate action] for too long.\u201d The two most straightforward of the trials will involve large-scale planting of trees and bioenergy crops, including Miscanthus grasses and coppice willow, reports Robert Lea for AZoCleanTech. The tree-planting trial will seek to determine the tree species that are most efficient at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in various locations, while the bioenergy trials may burn the grasses to create carbon-neutral fuels or find ways to store the accumulated biomass underground. In degraded peatlands in the South Pennines and West Wales, another trial will try to promote the formation of peat, a thick mat of organic matter that forms in some bogs, which is known to store vast quantities of carbon. Researchers will try to boost the unique landscape\u2019s powers of carbon sequestration by replanting and re-wetting, per the Guardian. A photo of biochar made from chicken waste and wood chips. Aside from being a stable way to store carbon, biochar is useful as a fertilizer. Jeff Hutchens \/ Getty Image The final two methods in the trials will use silicate rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, and biochar, a type of carbon-rich charcoal-like substance. The crushed rocks will be spread over farm in Devon, Hertfordshire and mid-Wales in hopes of sucking greenhouse gases into the soil and keeping them there. Biochar is made by superheating plant matter in the absence of oxygen, and the trial will explore burying it and spreading it over farmland as methods of storing its captured carbon, according to materials from UKRI. Speaking with the Guardian, Hepburn emphasized that carbon capture can\u2019t replace efforts to reduce emissions and that both are vital to averting climate disaster. \u201cWe are very alive to the possibility that companies will just use offsetting as greenwashing,\u201d Hepburn tells the Guardian. \u201cPart of what this program is about is to develop the monitoring, reporting and verification frameworks to ensure that removals are genuine.\u201d The announcement of these trials comes roughly six months ahead of the United Nations\u2019 Climate Change Conference of Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021, where countries around the world will meet to discuss strategies for addressing the global climate crisis. Per AZoCleanTech, the results of these trials could help decide future investments in carbon removal even beyond the United Kingdom.

Courtesy of Stratolaunch via Twitter On Thursday, an aircraft with two fuselages, six engines and a wingspan of 385 feet spent three hours and 14 minutes cruising above the Mojave Desert in California, Joey Roulette reports for the Verge. It was the second successful test flight of a behemoth aircraft designed by Stratolaunch and nicknamed \"Roc\" after the mythological bird said to carry off elephants as prey. The flight provided an opportunity to test how the plane would handle cabin pressurization and test new hardware upgrades and safety features that were added since the first test flight in April 2019. \u201cToday\u2019s flight, at first review, has appeared extremely successful,\u201d said Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch\u2019s chief operating officer, during a call with reporters, per the Verge. \u201cWe accomplished all test points as desired, we have not seen anything anomalous, and we are very pleased with the condition of the aircraft upon landing.\u201d We are airborne! pic.twitter.com\/6jTkkqfjKd\u2014 Stratolaunch (@Stratolaunch) April 29, 2021 When the plane touched down at the end of its flight, the wheels of one fuselage hit the ground while the other side of the aircraft remained in the air. While it appeared shaky to onlookers, Krevor says the lopsided maneuver is the proper procedure for landing the large plane in a crosswind, Alan Boyle reports for Geekwire. The test flight crew\u2014pilot Evan Thomas, pilot Mark Giddings and flight engineer Jake Riley\u2014worked in the right fuselage\u2019s cockpit, while the left side held instrumentation. Roc was originally designed to help launch satellites by ferrying rockets and their payloads to the upper atmosphere, removing the need for a first stage booster, Mike Wall writes for Space.com. But when Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft and founder of Stratolaunch, died in 2018, the company was sold to new owners and its mission re-focused. Now, Stratolaunch is framing Roc as a testbed for hypersonic vehicles and intends to partner with the Department of Defense. Hypersonic vehicles, or hypersonics, fly at beyond five times the speed of sound. Because they are both superfast and maneuverable, which makes them difficult to intercept, hypersonics are posed to be the next generation of missiles\u2014although not everyone believes the hype. Stratolaunch is developing Roc to carry their hypersonic test vehicle, called Talon-A, high into the atmosphere and deploy it. That strategy avoids the effort required to launch it from ground level and get it up to speed from zero. In the Thursday test flight, Roc reached 14,000 feet. \u201cOver the next year, the airplane will go higher, it will go faster, until we are in the envelope that\u2019s required to drop our Talon testbed so it can achieve hypersonic flight,\u201d said Stratolaunch\u2019s chief technical officer Daniel Millman during the call, Jeff Foust reports for Space News. Krevor adds that the next year of tests will include a \u201crange of flights\u201d of growing complexity, and that \u201cthe exact number of flights will be dependent on how we are able to complete the test objectives of each flight,\u201d per Space News. When Stratolaunch first took flight two years ago, it surpassed the H-4 Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose, as the widest aircraft. The Spruce Goose first flew in 1947 and had a wingspan of 320 feet. Theresa Machemer | READ MORE Theresa Machemer is a freelance writer based in Washington DC.

Mauritshuis Looking at Jan van der Heyden\u2019s 17th-century painting View of Oudezijds Voorburgwal with the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam, a modern viewer may notice a charming rowboat, gliding swans and old brick buildings. When Ariane van Suchtelen, curator of the Dutch art museum Mauritshuis, researched a new exhibition, she noticed something else. As she tells Artnet News\u2019s Menachem Wecker, the painting includes an outhouse that empties into the canal right beside a spot where a woman is washing her clothes. But, she says, most museum visitors looking at the painting probably project their experiences of the modern-day, relatively clean canals onto it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that \u2018smell memory,\u2019\u201d van Suchtelen says. A new exhibition, scheduled to open at Mauritshuis as soon as the museum safely reopens, will give visitors a deeper experience of this and other paintings by pairing the art with relevant experiences for the nose. Titled \u201cSmell the Art: Fleeting\u2013Scents in Colour,\u201d the show includes \u201cscent dispensers\u201d that, with the push of a foot pedal, release a puff of scented air. As Laura Cumming reports for the Guardian, the choice of 17th-century Dutch artwork as the subject of a smelly exhibition is fitting. Artists of that time and place were particularly interested in evoking smell and taste. Rembrandt van Rijn painted smelling salts in use in Unconscious Patient (Allegory of Smell) (c. 1624-25), while Abraham Mignon created bold-hued still lives of fruit and flowers. In addition to the polluted canal\u2014a smell Artnet News compares to \u201ca dirty gym bag full of spoiled fish\u201d\u2014the exhibition lets visitors experience the smells of a linen cupboard, bleaching fields, ambergris and myrrh. Another scent the museum provided to reporters replicates the perfume from a pomander\u2014a sweet-smelling container designed to ward off foul scents and \u201cbad air\u201d that 17th-century Europeans believed caused illness. Jan van der Heyden, View of the Oudezijds Voorburgwal with the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam, c.1670. Panel, 41.4 x 52.3 cm. Mauritshuis, The Hague Mauritshuis Other sections of the exhibition address the role of scent in 17th-century Dutch life. One theme is religious conflicts over Catholics\u2019 use of perfumed smoke as part of heavily sensory religious services, in contrast to the Protestant focus on the unadorned word of God. The exhibition also touches on how increasing trade with\u2014and exploitation of\u2014people in other parts of the world led to the arrival of new aromas. Some paintings on display can clearly suggest a smell even without a scent dispenser, like The Five Senses: Smell (1637) by Jan Miense Molenaer, which depicts a mother wiping her baby\u2019s bottom. Smell is often considered the most evocative sense. As Yale University neuroscientist Justus Verhagen tells Artnet News, there\u2019s a good reason for that. \u201cThe sense of smell is tightly interwoven with the evolutionarily old limbic system of the brain by having direct access to structures like the amygdala, hippocampal complex, and cortex,\u201d Verhagen says. \u201cThese are strongly involved in emotions and memories.\u201d In contrast, vision and other senses have a \u201cmuch less direct\u201d cognitive connection to memory and emotion. The exhibition is not the first to bring smells to a museum. As Pablo Alvarez de Toledo M\u00fcller of Spain\u2019s Nebrija University writes for the Conversation, olfactory art emerged as a discipline in the 1980s. The concept claimed the design of perfume and scents as an artistic endeavor and led to exhibitions designed with visitors\u2019 noses in mind, such as \u201cThe Art of Scent,\u201d which debuted at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York in 2012. \u201cFleeting\u2013Scents in Colour\u201d is set to open as soon as the Mauritshuis begins admitting visitors again and run through August 29. The museum is also preparing \u201cfragrance boxes\u201d with four of the scents from the exhibition. For \u20ac25 ($29.95), people can purchase scents to sniff at home while they participate in a digital tour of the show. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s been done before\u2014that you can actually smell something at home,\u201d van Suchtelen tells Artnet News. \u201cWe have to see how it works. This box is still an experiment.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian. She is also a freelance journalist based in New Hampshire.

Pictured: Smithsonian founder, James Smithson. MyHeritage Almost like animated, moving portraits in the Harry Potter franchise, photos once frozen in time are being brought to life with an artificial intelligence (A.I.) program called Deep Nostalgia. The technology, which was released on February 25 by the genealogy website MyHeritage, has since gone viral. Social media users have created lifelike moving portraits of mathematician Alan Turing, abolitionist Frederick Douglass and physicist Marie Curie, reports Mindy Weisberger for Live Science. The historical figures can blink, move their heads side-to-side, and even smile. The tech is also being used to animate artwork, statues and photos of ancestors. A.I. can create video footage or \"deepfakes\" using generative adversarial networks or GANs, Live Science reports. A GAN is composed of two A.I. systems working together to create content that appears eerily similar to the real thing. One system, the generator, creates a copy of an image using new data. Another system, the discriminator, determines if the data passes as real or fake. Over time, both tools will learn to create incredibly lifelike images that are difficult to distinguish from the originals, as reported by Adam Mann for Live Science in 2019. MyHeritage introduced Deep Nostalgia to allow users to see their ancestors or late relatives in motion. To create lifelike movements, the facial recognition company D-ID, which specializes in deep learning technology, uses GANs to animate the uploaded images. Footage of real people displaying different facial movements were used to train Deep Nostalgia's algorithm to apply motion to still photos, reports Ed Browne for Newsweek. \/ A 1933 oil on canvas portrait of Frida Kahlo by American artist Magda Pach.

Smithsonian American Art Museum, Transfer from the U.S. Department of the Interior through the General Services Administration The algorithm can recognize which pre-recorded video best fits with the photo depending on the subject's pose and applies natural facial movements to images that didn't previously move, reports Kim Lyons for Verge. \"Seeing our beloved ancestors' faces come to life in a video simulation lets us imagine how they might have been in reality, and provides a profound new way of connecting to our family history,\" Gilad Japhet, CEO and founder of MyHeritage, tells USA Today's Coral Murphy Marcos. Deep fakes have drawn controversy in recent years for their uncanny ability to create alterred videos or images of political figures and celebrities that can't be distinguished from the real thing. Deep fakes can be used for malicious purposes, such as splicing words into someone's speech, making it appear that they are saying something they never said. In other instances, the faces of Hollywood celebrities were edited onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos, reports AJ Willingham for CNN. Other critics note that historical figures were often very intentional about their posture and expression in photos, like Frederick Douglass, who has been called \"the most photographed American of the 19th century.\" He purposely chose photography as a medium for changing how the world viewed black men at the time. Images of black people existed, but often in subservient, violent or compromised positions in the context of slavery. In the 2015 book Picturing Frederick Douglass, Harvard historian John Stauffer explains that Douglass, as a former enslaved individual, believed photography \"highlighted the essential humanity of its subjects,\" reported Renee Graham for WBUR in 2016. Using Deep Nostaligia to make Douglass move and emote changes the radical message he was trying to convey. \"Douglass specifically\u2014in print, he said that he did not want\u2014he did not want to be portrayed as a happy slave,\" Stauffer told NPR in 2015. \"The smiling black was to play into the racist caricature. And his cause of ending slavery and ending racism had the gravity that required a stern look. And so he tended to confront the viewer, look directly into the camera.\" By March 4, the website already had ten million photos uploaded and animated, Newsweek reports. \"Indeed, the results can be controversial, and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology. This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life. Our driver videos don't include speech in order to prevent abuse of this, such as the creation of 'deep fake' videos of living people,\" MyHeritage states.

Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, eleventh Duke of Devonshire For decades, an unsettling portrait of Yale University\u2019s namesake and early benefactor, British American colonist Elihu Yale, carried a maddeningly incomplete description. The painting shows four white men in costly 18th-century outfits posing around a table, with Yale at the center. As the men smoke and sip madeira, Yale\u2019s grandchildren play in the field behind them. In the right corner of the canvas, a child of African descent pours wine for the group. He wears fine red and grey clothes and\u2014most disturbingly\u2014a silver collar locked around his neck. First donated to the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) in 1970 and exhibited sporadically over the past five decades, the painting was initially displayed with wall text that listed the men\u2019s titles but did not mention the enslaved child at their side. When the gallery was rehung in 2016, a new line acknowledged little beyond the boy\u2019s apparel: \u201cNothing is known ... except that his livery identifies him as a servant, and the padlocked collar indicates that he is enslaved.\u201d A boy of African descent, estimated to be about 10 years old, serves madeira to the wealthy white men at the table. Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire Unanswered questions about the enslaved child haunted New Haven resident Titus Kaphar when he first saw the portrait in 2016. Inspired, the artist painted Enough About You, which warps the 18th-century work beyond recognition, save for the boy\u2019s portrait, which is framed in gold. Kaphar\u2019s subject stares directly at the viewer and does not wear a collar. As the artist told Terence Trouillot of Artnet Newsin 2019, \u201cI decided to physically take action to quiet [and crumple] the side of the painting that we\u2019ve been talking about for a very long time and turn up the volume on this kid\u2019s story.\u201d Four years after Kaphar created Enough About You, the YCBA embarked on a project to do just that. Last fall, after a landmark summer of protests against racial injustice, director Courtney J. Martin decided to temporarily remove the Yale group portrait from view. The museum hung Kaphar\u2019s painting, on an eight-month loan from private collectors in California, in its place. Meanwhile, a group of five YCBA employees volunteered to research the enslaved child and his portrait in new depth. Software engineer Eric James, senior curatorial assistant Abigail Lamphier, senior library assistant Lori Misura, coordinator of cataloging David K. Thompson and assistant curator Edward Town published their initial findings online earlier this year. Viewers can explore the report via the YCBA website and the related Yale and Slavery Research Project website. As of this week, members of the public can once again view the reinstalled Yale portrait, bolstered by rewritten wall texts that add newfound historical context to the image, as Nancy Kenney reports for the Art Newspaper. \u201cHow long will it stay [up]? That\u2019s the answer I don\u2019t have just yet,\u201d Martin tells the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe conversation is evolving.\u201d Titus Kaphar, Enough About You, 2016 Photo by Richard Caspole \/ Collection of Arthur Lewis and Hau Nguyen \/ Courtesy of the artist The painting\u2019s new label holds several revelations from the researchers. Whereas previous estimates had dated the portrait to 1708, chemical analysis conducted in the past year now suggests that it was completed around 1719. The experts also ascribed the formerly unattributed work to John Verelst, a Dutch portraitist working in Britain during that period, and retitled it Elihu Yale With Members of His Family and an Enslaved Child. Though the team has yet to uncover the identity of the Black child, Town tells Smithsonian that he still has hope. Scholars sometimes argue that European artists did not paint people of African or Indian descent from real-life models but instead invented from fabricated stereotypes\u2014an assumption that strikes Town as \u201cunsatisfying and wrong.\u201d \u201cThe full story hasn\u2019t yet been told,\u201d he says. Recovering the child\u2019s biography \u201cmight prove impossible, but it is still the goal here.\u201d Despite lacking a name for the child, the YCBA team has managed to flesh out some details of his life and status. Based on input from pediatricians, the team estimates that he was about 10 years old. He would have been one of many people, mostly boys under the age of 10, taken from their families in British colonies in Africa and India and forced to work as enslaved \u201cpages\u201d in the households of wealthy white men. (This work in particular was probably painted at Yale\u2019s house in London.) The child\u2019s enslavers also forced him to wear a padlocked collar. As the Art Newspaper reports, this was a common practice: YCBA researchers have identified at least 50 other paintings made in Britain between 1660 and 1760 that depict enslaved individuals wearing similar collars, sometimes engraved with an enslaver\u2019s name or other identifying marks. \u201cThis collar is not used to tether someone to another set of chains, in the way that a similar-looking object would be in Jamaica or Barbados at the same time,\u201d says Town. Rather, \u201c[o]ne of the invidious, cruelest things about it is that these collars would have been highly finished, high-status objects.\u201d As instruments of control, the bands symbolically marked their wearers as enslaved and prevented them from easily running away. Town is careful to qualify that the precise details of this child\u2019s bondage would have differed from the experiences of enslaved people in the British colonies, where slavery was codified by law. Chattel slavery technically had \u201cno legal basis\u201d in England, per Historic U.K. But many Black people were forced to work in British households in \u201can ill-defined but often violently enforced state of what historians have characterized as \u2018slavish servitude,\u2019\u201d the researchers write. (The slippery legal semantics around enslavement within Britain\u2019s shoreline would later be tested in court, most notably in the 1772 case of James Somerset, adds Town.) The child\u2019s precise relationship with the four men in the painting is likewise unclear. Some clues have come to light: for instance, the man standing at Yale\u2019s shoulder is newly identified as David Yale, the patriarch\u2019s adopted heir. He looms over Lord James Cavendish, to the left of Yale, and a figure now identified as Yale\u2019s son-in-law William Cavendish, on the right. In other words, this is a family portrait that Yale likely commissioned near the end of his life to promote his power and legacy, says Town. Born in 1649 in Boston, the merchant made his fortune during a 20-year tenure working for (and stealing from) the East India Company in present-day Chennai (then called Madras). He later retired in luxury to Wales and England. In 1718, he donated a set of expensive goods to the future Yale University, lending the young Connecticut college its name. Town and historian Teanu Reid note that the extent of Yale\u2019s direct involvement in the trade of enslaved people remains unclear. But other scholars argue that he certainly would have benefited and profited from the trade indirectly, as Mark Alden Branch reported for Yale Alumni magazine last year. No known written records prove that Yale personally enslaved people. His private papers are missing\u2014a fact that further complicates efforts to determine how the young boy ended up painted into a group portrait. This lack of a paper trail means that researchers can\u2019t say for certain whether Yale or one of his relatives claimed ownership of the child. That being said, \u201c[f]or me, it\u2019s splitting hairs, because they\u2019re all one social and economic and familial unit,\u201d says Town. James Worsdale painted this work, Elihu Yale With His Servant, sometime in the 18th century. The painting was removed from public display in 2007. Public domain via Yale University Art Gallery Research into the boy\u2019s identity and story is ongoing. Archivists are currently investigating regional archives located near the estates of Yale and his sons-in-law, who owned properties in Suffolk, Buckinghamshire and Derbyshire, for clues about their lives, businesses and households, per the Art Newspaper. While Yale\u2019s relationship to the institution of slavery is subject to historical debate, he was certainly comfortable sitting for portraits that featured enslaved people. Of the seven painted likenesses of Yale in the university\u2019s holdings, three depict him alongside an enslaved person: the aforementioned family portrait attributed to Verelst, a rendition of the same group on copper and a separate full-length portrait that once hung in the university\u2019s Corporation Room. The last of these, which was removed from public view in 2007 due to its racist themes, shows an enslaved adult of Indian or South Asian heritage walking up to Yale and holding out a letter. The artist, James Worsdale, attempts to marginalize the figure of the servant, depicting him as emerging from the shadows and rendering him as slight compared to Yale\u2019s imposing bulk. Similarly, Verelst painted the young African boy in the corner of his group composition. In a 2014 YCBA exhibition, curators asked attendees to disobey these visual cues and instead consider the enslaved child in the portrait as if he were the focus of the work. As Kaphar demonstrated with Enough About You, artists can encourage members of the public to \u201creframe\u201d portraits like Elihu Yale, literally and figuratively. \u201cI wanted to find a way to imagine a life for this young man that the historical painting had never made space for in the composition: his desires, dreams, family, thoughts, hopes,\u201d Kaphar told Artnet News in 2019. \u201cThose things were never subjects that the original artist wanted the viewer to contemplate.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Each day, she peered inside the windows and watched the animators at work\u2014until someone took notice of her and invited her inside. \u201cI think it was Walt [Disney] because he roamed around quite a bit,\u201d Tompson later recalled. She became such a fixture at the studio that Walt\u2019s brother, Roy, brought an apple box for her to sit on, transfixed, as animations came to life around her. \u201c[A]s it got late, he would say, \u2018I think you\u2019d better go home. Your mother probably wants you to come home for dinner.\u2019\u201d These visits marked the start of Tompson\u2019s long, fruitful association with the Walt Disney Company. After graduating from high school, she formally joined the studio as an inker and painter, transferring animators\u2019 drawings from paper onto \u201ccels,\u201d or celluloid sheets used in the filmmaking process. Over the next 40-odd years, she took on roles in final check, scene planning and the camera department. Her work\u2014\u201dlargely unheralded,\u201d writes Margalit Fox for the New York Times\u2014helped shape many of the beloved children\u2019s films produced during Disney\u2019s Golden Age, among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. Tompson retired from Disney in 1975. Walt Disney Company On October 10, at the age of 111, Tompson \u201cpassed away peacefully in her sleep\u201d at her home in the Motion Picture and Television Fund\u2019s retirement community in Woodland Hills, California, Disney announced in a statement. \u201cRuthie was a legend among animators,\u201d says Bob Iger, executive chairman of the Walt Disney Company, in the statement. \u201cWhile we will miss her smile and wonderful sense of humor, her exceptional work and pioneering spirit will forever be an inspiration to us all.\u201d Born in Portland, Maine, in 1910, Tompson moved to California with her family when she was 8 years old. Her childhood was suffused with Disney: She lived down the street from Robert Disney, Walt\u2019s uncle, and in addition to being a regular observer of the Disney film studio, appeared as a live-action reference model for an early series of shorts, the Alice Comedies. She received 25 to 50 cents for each picture and used the money to buy licorice. When she was 18, Tompson took a job at a riding academy in the San Fernando Valley, where the Disney brothers often played polo. Though he had not seen her since she was a child, Walt recognized her \u201csignature Buster Brown haircut,\u201d and invited her to work with him, wrote Patricia Zohn for Vanity Fair in 2010. Tompson replied that she couldn\u2019t \u201cdraw worth a nickel,\u201d but Disney was undeterred, promising that the studio would send her to night school so she could learn the craft of inking and painting. The first film Tompson worked on was the studio\u2019s first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She joined a group of about 100 women, some of them \u201cprofoundly gifted artists\u201d who were barred from animation jobs because of their gender, per the Times. Tompson didn\u2019t have the steady, delicate touch needed to work with the inkers, who \u201cnot only had to trace the animators\u2019 pencil lines exactly but also had to capture the feeling of what the animators were intending in the scenes,\u201d according to the Walt Disney Family Museum. Instead, she was assigned to paint in the lines that had been traced by the inkers. Soon, Tompson was promoted to the position of final checker, making her responsible for reviewing animation cels before they were photographed onto film. \u201cOut of a 500-cel scene, every four or five would be painted by a different girl, so the colors had to follow through,\u201d she explained in 2007. \u201cIf they put blue in the wrong place, we\u2019d have to take them back and have them redo them.\u201d In 1948, Tompson began working as both an animation checker reviewing artists\u2019 work for inconsistencies and a scene planner\u2014a role that required her to guide how the camera should move to bring vitality to the animations. Tompson was named a Disney legend in 2000. Walt Disney Company \u201cShe really had to know all the mechanics of making the image work on the screen as the director, the layout person and the animator preferred: how to make Peter Pan walk, or fly, in the specified time,\u201d John Canemaker, a historian and Oscar-winning animator, tells the Times. \u201cWhat she did ended up on the screen\u2014whether you see her hand or not\u2014because of the way she supported the directors\u2019 vision.\u201d Though she operated behind the scenes, Tompson\u2019s technical skill was recognized when she became one of the first three women admitted to the International Photographers Union, reports Rachel Treisman for NPR. She continued working for Disney until her retirement from the studio in 1975, making invaluable contributions to \u201cvirtually every Disney animated feature up through The Rescuers,\u201d per the statement. In 2000, Tompson was named a Disney Legend, a title bestowed for exceptional contributions to the company. Last year, in honor of Tompson\u2019s 110th birthday, a celebration was held at the Motion Picture & Television Fund campus. Staff decorated the halls according to Tompson\u2019s two passions: Disney and the Dodgers. When asked the secret to her longevity, Tompson joked that she was a vampire before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am still here, but I know that I don\u2019t want to be revered for how old I am. I want to be known for who I am.\u201d Brigit Katz | | READ MORE Brigit Katz is a freelance writer based in Toronto.

FlickrDelusions via Flickr under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 The University of Oxford\u2019s Oriel College has installed a plaque identifying 19th-century politician and diamond-mining magnate Cecil Rhodes as a \u201ccommitted British colonialist.\u201d Placed beside a much-debated statue of Rhodes, the plaque immediately came under fire from both advocates of removing the sculpture and their opponents. Oxford city councilor Shaista Aziz, who was a member of the college\u2019s Independent Commission of Inquiry into the statue, calls the plaque \u201camateurish\u201d and \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d reports Indya Clayton for the Oxford Mail. Aziz adds that the sign does \u201cnothing to address the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, a loud, proud white supremacist, colonialist and slave owner and a deeply controversial figure of his time.\u201d The new plaque notes that the building where the statue stands was constructed with money bequeathed by Rhodes in his will. Upon his death in 1902, Rhodes, a former Oriel student, left the college the equivalent of about $17 million in today\u2019s dollars. The plaque states that Rhodes \"obtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\" Dan Hicks via Twitter Per the sign, Rhodes \u201cobtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\u201d Though the college \u201cdeclared its wish to remove the statue\u201d following widespread protests against systemic racism last year, it opted not to do so in accordance with \u201clegal and regulatory advice.\u201d A line at the bottom of the plaque directs readers to a website featuring additional context about the statue and Rhodes himself. Cambridge historian David Abulafia tells the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Turner that the sign \u201clacks balance.\u201d \u201cHe believed he was bringing benefits to Africa,\u201d Abulafia says. \u201cWe might now argue that he did more harm than good, but one has to understand what his intentions were. He is portrayed here as some sort of devil incarnate.\u201dAs an @OrielOxford alumnus I am dismayed to see the sniveling cowardice shown in the face of the left-wing mob. Like many other Oriel graduates I am grateful for the education I received at Oxford in large part due to the generosity of Rhodes' bequest. https:\/\/t.co\/s1jsZKSy8r\u2014 Nile Gardiner (@NileGardiner) October 10, 2021 For more than a year, the Oxford statue has been a target of the Rhodes Must Fall movement, which began as a series of student-led protests in South Africa in 2015, as Justin Parkinson reported for BBC News at the time. Linking Rhodes\u2019 legacy to continuing inequity in wealth and opportunities in the country, protesters successfully campaigned for the removal of a prominent statue of Rhodes at the University of Cape Town. Founder of the De Beers diamond company, Rhodes served as prime minister of Britain\u2019s Cape Colony, in what\u2019s now South Africa, from 1890 to 1896. In addition to profiting enormously from the region\u2019s mineral wealth, Rhodes advocated for monumental expansion of the British Empire, including bringing the United States back under British control. He sought to create a \u201cred line\u201d on the map of Africa, with everything from Cairo to Cape Town belonging to Britain. \u201cI contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race,\u201d Rhodes once said. Last year, in the midst of global activism following the police killing of George Floyd, activists in Oxford demanded the removal of Rhode\u2019s likeness. Protesters around the world also toppled statues of other figures linked to slavery and colonialism, including Confederate generals and enslavers. In Bristol, an English city west of Oxford, a crowd dumped a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston into a nearby harbor.the Rhodes Must Fall Oxford campaign did not, from memory, call for the erection of a third college memorial to Cecil Rhodesthis small metal sign is an embarrassment and reveals the incoherence and futility of the ideology of \u201cRetain and Explain\u201d pic.twitter.com\/Ft50hPpVQ4\u2014 Dan Hicks (@profdanhicks) October 11, 2021 A majority of the independent commission\u2019s members supported removing Oriel\u2019s Rhodes statue. But the college decided in May that it would not do so, citing the difficult legal and planning process involved, per Jamie Grierson and Damien Gayle of the Guardian. According to the Oxford Mail, the new plaque is a temporary measure that will eventually be replaced with a permanent response to the controversy. In January, United Kingdom officials announced a new \u201cretain and explain\u201d policy that keeps controversial historical statues in place with added context. This week, the City of London Corporation announced that memorials to William Beckford and John Cass, politicians with ties to the transatlantic slave trade, would remain standing alongside new explanatory texts, reports Taylor Dafoe for Artnet News. \u201cIt enables us to acknowledge and address the legacy of our past with openness and honesty,\u201d says Doug Barrow, chair of a subcommittee that considered the Beckford and Cass statues, in a statement. \u201cNot to try and erase history but to place it in its proper context.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Illustration by Niklas Elmehed \u00a9 Nobel Prize Outreach Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah has won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \u201cuncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.\u201d Born in 1948, the writer grew up in Zanzibar. After the island liberated itself from the British Empire in 1963, a violent uprising led to widespread persecution of Arab-descended minorities. As a member of a targeted ethnic group, 18-year-old Gurnah was forced to seek refuge in England, writes Alison Flood for the Guardian. While in exile abroad, Gurnah wrote to cope with the trauma of dislocation. \u201cThe thing that motivated the whole experience of writing for me was this idea of losing your place in the world,\u201d he tells the New York Times\u2019 Alexandra Alter and Alex Marshall.World exclusive: Listen to our interview with 2021 literature laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah on the value that refugees can bring to a country. #NobelPrize pic.twitter.com\/AkejPuzVjo\u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 7, 2021 Though Swahili is Gurnah\u2019s first language, \u201cEnglish became his literary tool,\u201d notes the Swedish Academy, which awards the annual prize, in a statement. Since 1987, he has published ten novels and numerous short stories, many of which follow the lives of refugees as they reckon with loss, displacement and the lasting trauma caused by European colonization of the African continent. A professor emeritus of English and postcolonial studies at the University of Kent, Gurnah has also published literary criticism on Indian-British novelist Salman Rushdie and Kenyan novelist and academic Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong\u2019o, among others. Gurnah\u2019s debut novel, Memory of Departure, relates the travails of a young man on the East African coast who comes of age under the oppressive conditions of a totalitarian regime. In Paradise, which was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker Prize and is described in the statement as his \u201cbreakthrough\u201d work, Gurnah writes from the perspective of Yusuf, a 12-year-old boy who is forced into indentured servitude in East Africa in the years leading up to World War I. As V.V. Ganeshananthan noted for the New York Times in 2017, even Gurnah\u2019s minor characters tend to have \u201crichly imagined histories\u201d that bring their unique identities to life. This is an intentional choice: Speaking with Judyannet Muchiri of Africa in Words about his most recent novel, Afterlives, Gurnah explained: My interest was not to write about the war or the ugliness of colonialism. Instead I want to make sure the context in which war and colonialism happened is understood. And that the people in that context were people with entire existences. Gurnah\u2019s win has been hailed by some as a sign of progress for the Swedish Academy, which has historically favored white, male and European writers. He is the first Black writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature since Toni Morrison in 1993, reports Andrew Limbong for NPR. Meanwhile, the last Black African writer to win the award was Wole Soyinka in 1986. Speaking with Alex Shephard of the New Republic, Nobel Committee Chair Anders Olsson \u201cdemurred\u201d on the question of whether Europe\u2019s ongoing migrant crisis \u201chad any immediate impact on our decision,\u201d instead arguing that \u201cthe phenomenon of exile and migration has been there for many, many years.\u201d Gurnah was an unexpected honoree, Shephard writes, as his novels \u201care largely unknown outside of the U.K. and aren\u2019t particularly well known inside of it.\u201d On Twitter, journalist Jane Friedman pointed out that Gurnah has sold just 3,000 print copies in the United States to date. Last year, American poet Louise Gl\u00fcck won the award for her \u201cunmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal.\u201d Including Gl\u00fcck, just 16 of the prize\u2019s 118 recipients have been women. As Shephard observes in in his annual commentary on the award, \u201cThe prize has been awarded to Europeans 14 times this century\u2014this despite the Nobel Committee\u2019s vocal emphasis on greater diversity and its quasi-public apologies for the prize\u2019s well-earned reputation for Eurocentrism.\u201d The Swedish Academy itself has been mired in controversy in recent years. In 2017, an academy member\u2019s husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, was accused of serial sexual assault and leaking the names of prize winners to bookies. The resulting scandal delayed the announcement of the 2018 prize winner by a full year and led indirectly to the resignation of multiple academy members. Arnault was later convicted of rape and sentenced to two years in prison. The academy has also faced criticism for its selection of Austrian author Peter Handke as the 2019 literature laureate. Handke has previously expressed support for late Serbian dictator Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and publicly denied the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Earlier this week, the Academy announced the Nobel Prizes for physics, chemistry and medicine. The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday. Last year, the World Food Program, a United Nations organization that addresses food insecurity around the world, took home the prestigious award.

He had high hopes for the artwork, believing that it would serve as his ticket into the Parisian art market. But the painting\u2019s reception was negative, even scathing. \u201cYou can do better than this,\u201d wrote Anthon van Rappard, a fellow painter and friend of van Gogh, in a letter. Now, reports Daniel Boffey for the Guardian, a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is inviting visitors to carefully consider The Potato Eaters, which the artist continued to hold in high regard despite the criticism against it. Later, during a period of personal crisis, van Gogh actually made plans to work on a second version of the painting. \u201cHe is very, very convinced of the power of his work and the message it conveys,\u201d says curator Bregje Gerritse to Bruno Waterfield of the London Times. Vincent van Gogh, Hand With a Stick, and Four People Sharing a Meal, March\u2013April 1885, chalk on paper Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation \u201cThe Potato Eaters: Mistake or Masterpiece?\u201d features around 50 paintings, drawings, sketches and letters that tell the story of van Gogh\u2019s rustic supper scene. He began working on The Potato Eaters while living with his parents in Nuenen, a rural town in the Netherlands that was home to many farmers, laborers and weavers. It was the perfect place to capture peasant life, a subject of interest to van Gogh and many of his contemporaries. Per a statement, the exhibition includes 10 of the 40 studies of peasants\u2019 faces that van Gogh created over the span of a single winter, among them a portrait of Gordina de Groot, who appears in The Potato Eaters. Van Gogh hoped to prove himself as a figure painter, but he had little experience painting full-length portraits. The peasant meal was a popular theme among artists at the time, and it allowed van Gogh to depict his subjects sitting down. Uncharacteristically, he created many preliminary studies for The Potato Eaters, visiting the de Groot cottage repeatedly to capture the family as they ate their evening meal. He sketched out small details\u2014a clock, a spoon rack, a chunk of bread, a hand on a teapot\u2014to prepare for the painting. The final result shows five people gathered around a table, eating potatoes and drinking coffee. The figures are painted in earth tones\u2014\u201csomething like the color of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course,\u201d as the artist once reflected. Their hands are gnarled from hard work, their faces bony, their eyes dark and expressive. Unlike other painters of the same subject, van Gogh did not idealize peasant life. According to the Van Gogh Museum, he wanted to convey that the family members \u201chave tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food.\u201d Despite van Gogh\u2019s hard work and his ambitions for The Potato Eaters, the painting was not featured in an exhibition during the artist\u2019s lifetime. In fact, writes Waterfield for the Times, it was \u201cgreeted by almost universal disapproval.\u201d Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh with sketch of a head of a woman (Gordina de Groot), circa May 28, 1885 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation The withering letter from van Rappard exemplifies critical disdain for the painting\u2019s technical execution. \u201c[W]hy may that man on the right not have a knee or a belly or lungs?\u201d he chastised. \u201cOr are they in his back? And why must his arm be a meter too short? And why must he lack half of his nose? \u2026 Art is too important, it seems to me, to be treated so cavalierly.\u201d This review must have been particularly devastating to van Gogh because, as the Guardian points out, he struggled with group compositions\u2014a genre of which van Rappard was a master. Van Gogh sent the letter back to his friend with a response defending The Potato Eaters, in which he argued that van Rappard had missed the essence of the painting: \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to get with it is to be able to draw not a hand but the gesture, not a mathematically correct head but the overall expression. The sniffing of the wind when a digger looks up, say, or speaking. Life, in short.\u201d The Potato Eaters continued to linger in van Gogh\u2019s mind, even after he moved to France and perfected a markedly different\u2014and now iconic\u2014style defined by bright colors and loose brushwork. In April 1889, following a mental health crisis, van Gogh asked to be admitted to an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence in the south of France. During this period of confinement, he started planning a new version of The Potato Eaters, writing in a letter that the \u201ccanvas must be completely dark now, perhaps I could redo it entirely from memory.\u201d Vincent van Gogh, Study for The Potato Eaters, April 1885 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation Van Gogh made preparatory sketches for the second version, including an 1890 drawing of five figures clustered around a table. This work, along with several other preliminary sketches, are featured in the new exhibition. \u201cSome of these are drawings that have not been on display for such a long time that our records even suggest they were never shown,\u201d Gerritse tells the Guardian. The artist never carried out his plans for a second Potato Eaters. In late July 1890, with his mental health spiraling, the artist shot himself in the chest. He died two days later. Today, The Potato Eaters is considered one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous works\u2014a vindication of his claim that the painting was \u201cthe best thing I did.\u201d Gerritse says contemporary observers can see the artist\u2019s fortitude in his commitment to this masterpiece. \u201cI really like that van Gogh stands behind his own work,\u201d the curator tells the Guardian. \u201cHe says there is a certain life in it, writing that while, of course, there are technical mistakes but that technical perfection isn\u2019t what he is after; it is the impression that it conveys about peasant life that is much more important.\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters: Mistake or Masterpiece?\u201d is on view at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam through February 13, 2022.

But they played with sticks instead of fir-cones, because they were easier to mark.\u201d The place where Pooh and his lovable band of buddies played their game was inspired by a real bridge in Ashdown Forest, the heathland in southeast England where Milne purchased a country home for his family in 1924. Known as Poohsticks Bridge, the literary landmark is now up for auction, reports Theresa Waldrop for CNN. Built in 1907, the structure was originally called Posingford Bridge. It served as a river crossing for pedestrians, carts and horses, according to auction house Summers Place. Milne\u2019s son, Christopher Robin\u2014who lends his name to Pooh\u2019s human companion\u2014came upon the bridge during one of his jaunts through Ashdown Forest, the bucolic inspiration for Hundred Acre Wood, which Pooh and his friends call home. Poohsticks is attributed to the silly old bear in Milne\u2019s stories, but it was the author and his son who actually invented the game as they played together on Posingford Bridge. \u201cI first found the bridge 20 years after it had been built when I came upon it with my nanny,\u201d Christopher later said, as quoted by the Guardian\u2019s Nikki Knewstub. \u201cHow could we not fall in love with it? Then my parents came and how could they not fall in love with it?\u201d Milne\u2019s first Winnie-the-Pooh collection, published in 1926, was an instant hit both in England and abroad. The House at Pooh Corner, his second volume of Pooh stories, includes an illustration of Posingford Bridge by E.H. Shepard, who created iconic sketches of scenes from Milne\u2019s work. The bridge subsequently became a destination for fans of Pooh, who flocked there to play their own games of Poohsticks. Christopher officially renamed the structure \u201cPoohsticks Bridge\u201d during a ceremony in 1979, according to Anita Singh of the Telegraph. Of course, Pooh is global, but at the same time he is a very English creation. Years of foot traffic took their toll on the landmark, which by 1999 was so worn down that it was taken apart and stored at the Ashdown Forest Center. A new bridge was put in its place, funded by local groups and the Disney Corporation, which acquired the rights to Pooh in 1961. But the area\u2019s parish council recently allowed two anonymous buyers to purchase and rebuild the original. Local oak was used to replace any missing parts, and the fully restored bridge is now available for purchase. \u201cThe dismantled bridge lay neglected for years until these two enterprising guys acquired it,\u201d James Rylands, director of Summers Place, tells the Telegraph. The sellers, he adds, are \u201cquite happy\u201d to rebuild the bridge if it needs to be taken apart during transport. Some observers have expressed concern that Poohsticks Bridge will be sold to a buyer outside of England, much like Christopher\u2019s childhood toys, which gave rise to Milne\u2019s stories and are now held by the New York Public Library. \u201cOf course, Pooh is global, but at the same time he is a very English creation,\u201d British broadcaster and teddy bear aficionado Gyles Brandreth tells the Telegraph. Others are more pragmatic. \u201cIt was a pile of old junk wood that nobody wanted\u2014and if somebody has made something of it and can sell it as a bit of Winnie-the-Pooh history, good luck to them,\u201d an unnamed local said to the Telegraph. All bids for the bridge, which is expected to sell for between $54,000 and $81,000, are due today. Wherever it ends up, Poohsticks Bridge is now whole again\u2014and perhaps it can be used once more as a place to play on a \u201cpeaceful sort of day,\u201d just as Milne and his son (and Pooh) used to do.

Most of Andy Warhol\u2019s screenprints and sculptures reproduce instantly recognizable icons of American pop culture: Campbell soup cans, Brillo soap pads, Elvis, Marilyn Monroe. But the Pop Art pioneer, inspired by the sparse creations of predecessors Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt, also dabbled in abstract painting. Working in the 1970s and \u201980s, Warhol rendered some of his lesser-known abstract canvases with an unusual set of materials: namely, his own urine and semen. One of these so-called oxidation paintings, Jean-Michel Basquiat (1982), is set to go on auction at Christie\u2019s next month, reports Tom Seymour for the Art Newspaper. The portrait, which features a black-and-white silkscreen image of Basquiat covered with green splotches, is expected to fetch upwards of $20 million. To create Jean-Michel Basquiat and other oxidation works, Warhol coated canvases with copper or gold paint and either peed on them himself or invited friends and assistants to urinate directly onto the canvas. Acid from the urine reacted with the metallic paint, oxidizing to create an \u201cabstract shimmering effect,\u201d per Shira Wolfe of Artland. Warhol once wrote in his diary that he preferred the \u201ccontributions\u201d of assistant Ronnie Cutrone \u201cbecause he takes a lot of vitamin B so the canvas turns a really pretty color when it\u2019s his piss.\u201d The artist also experimented with splashing, brushing or pouring various bodily fluids onto his paintings. L to R: Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Bruno Bischofberger and Fransesco Clemente, pictured in New York City in 1984 Galerie Bruno Bischofberger via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 4.0 As Christie\u2019s noted in the 2008 lot description for a similar creation, Warhol\u2019s use of taboo bodily fluids in works of art was likely inspired by practices in New York\u2019s underground fetish scene. These \u201c\u2018piss paintings\u2019 insist on a frank carnality in their method of execution,\u201d the auction house added. \u201cTurning the body into a brush, Warhol alchemically transforms waste into artistic creation.\u201d The artist\u2019s oxidation works also took a playful dig at Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist whose commanding personality dominated the modern art world until his death in 1956. Pollock was an early devotee of \u201callover painting,\u201d in which artists covered compositions in layers, splotches, drips and stains of paint. \u201cWarhol\u2019s use of an allover drip technique can be seen as both an homage and a queer send-up of the machismo of Jackson Pollock\u2019s canonical Abstract Expressionist works,\u201d wrote the Whitney Museum of American Art in its 2018 exhibition, \u201cAndy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again. Warhol created the soon-to-be auctioned, 40- by 40-inch portrait of friend and fellow artist Basquiat in 1982. He transferred a Polaroid image of the young artist to the canvas, then peed on its surface. Jean-Michel Basquiat, Dos Cabezas, 1982 Courtesy of Christie's Images, Ltd. \u201cThe uric acid from Warhol\u2019s body discolored the metal, creating pockmarks of rust, black and green, and fusing the bodies of the two men in both form and content,\u201d notes the Art Newspaper. Though the pair ran in similar New York City social circles, Warhol and Basquiat only began collaborating on October 4, 1982, when their shared agent, Bruno Bischofberger, organized a meeting. Within hours of the gathering, Basquiat had painted a vibrant joint portrait, Dos Cabezas, that placed the newly acquainted artists\u2019 looming heads side by side. (\u201cWhile Basquiat's expediency may have been motivated in part by an eager desire for Warhol's approval, ... his delivery mere hours later may also have been intended to alert Warhol to just how little time was spent working on it,\u201d wrote art historian Tony Morris in a 2020 article.) In response, Warhol created his oxidization portrait, which Morris argued \u201cshould be read in the same spirit of competition, admiration and clever insult expressed by Basquiat.\u201d The younger artist, for his part, hung Warhol\u2019s portrait of him in his apartment. It was the only work not by Basquiat on view in the residence. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a piss painting,\u201d Basquiat later told Anthony Haden-Guest of Vanity Fair. The 1982 portrait exchange launched an intense friendship and creative partnership that endured until a failed joint exhibition in 1985. The former friends failed to reconcile before Warhol\u2019s sudden death in February 1987; Basquiat died of a heroin overdose in August 1988 at just 27 years old. \u201c[T]his portrait of Jean Michel-Basquiat was created when the young artist was at the precipice of entering the New York art world and changing it forever,\u201d says Alex Rotter, Christie\u2019s chairman of 20th- and 21st-century art, in a statement. \u201cFrom Brooklyn to China, Basquiat symbolizes a new generation, and Warhol recognized this earlier than anyone. His unmatched ability to capture celebrity, fame, glory, and tragedy culminates in this portrait.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

But what they\u2019re actually seeing is a work of art masquerading as an advert (or vice versa)\u2014one of many Barbara Kruger creations splashed onto billboards, bus stops and storefronts as part of a major exhibition now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC). \u201cThinking of You. I Mean Me. I Mean You.\u201d runs through January 24 before traveling to two co-organizing institutions: the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The artist\u2019s biggest survey to date, the show spills over into the streets of Chicago, underscoring Kruger\u2019s signature appropriation of the visual language of tabloids, advertisements and other mass media. For previous shows, Kruger has designed MetroCards, wrapped a Manhattan city bus in quotes from famous figures and painted the Pledge of Allegiance on a warehouse in L.A.\u2019s Little Tokyo neighborhood. Now, she\u2019s transforming Chicago into her personal canvas, decorating everything from storefronts along Michigan Avenue to the stairs and exterior windows of the Art Institute building itself. (Those interested in locating all of Kruger\u2019s work within and around the museum grounds can peruse a map here.) Barbara Kruger, Untitled (Truth), 2013 Collection of Margaret and Daniel S. Loeb \/ Digital image courtesy of the artist In rare, site-specific works of immense scale, curators painstakingly covered the museum\u2019s 18,000-square-foot Regenstein Hall and 8,000-square-foot Griffin Court atrium with vinyl prints of Kruger\u2019s work. (\u201cIn the 33 years since Regenstein Hall was built, this is the first time we have covered the entire floor,\u201d notes project manager Courtney Smith in an AIC blog post.) Workers also installed speakers throughout the museum to project Kruger\u2019s immersive sound installations. Over her four-decade career, Kruger has continually blurred the distinction between commercialism and art. Even those unfamiliar with her work will almost certainly recognize the artist\u2019s distinctive white text, emblazoned on red or black backgrounds in the sans serif font Futura, writes Kyle MacMillan for the Chicago Sun-Times. Barbara Kruger, Thinking of You. I Mean Me. I Mean You., 2019 Digital image courtesy of the artist The exhibition includes works from throughout Kruger\u2019s career, some of which have been reworked specifically for the show. Several of the artist\u2019s trademark images are reinterpreted as video works on enormous L.E.D. screens in the galleries, per the Sun-Times. These reimagined works include Untitled (I shop therefore I am) (1987\/2019), which references an older body of work about mass culture and consumerism. \u201cI would not call [this exhibition] a retrospective,\u201d Kruger tells Julie Baumgardner of Artnet News. \u201c[I]t\u2019s a conflation of new works and renovations of older works and changing them.\u201d The artist adds that the show\u2019s unusual title, which must be formatted with strikethroughs in place, refers to \u201cour own ego constructions, our narratives, our ability to speak and listen, our investment in our voice, or others\u2014all those shifting positions.\u201d Barbara Kruger's Justice, 1997, depicts J. Edgar Hoover and Roy Cohn embracing. Courtesy of the artist, Spr\u00fcth Magers, and David Zwirner, New York \/ Photo courtesy of Mary Boone Gallery, New York Kruger\u2019s taste for simple fonts and bold images contrasts with the complex messages of her works, which \u201cundermine and expose the power dynamics of identity, desire and consumerism,\u201d per an AIC statement. Her best-known works employ pithy epigrams and images to arrest viewers\u2019 attention in humorous, thought-provoking and sometimes disconcerting ways. As Philip Kennicott writes for the Washington Post, the exhibition features a 1982 image by Kruger that overlays an image of Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel frescoes with the words \u201cYou invest in the divinity of the masterpiece.\u201d Its meaning is purposefully ambiguous, according to Kennicott: \u201cThe \u2018you\u2019 could refer to the art world, which traffics in art as a commodity while pretending it is somehow sacred or beyond ordinary terrestrial valuation.\u201d Or, he argues, Kruger could be poking fun at the \u201cart-loving tourist, who consumes energy and other resources only to stand before a painting and mutter meaningless platitudes about its divinity.\u201d Kruger designed one of her most famous images for the 1989 Women\u2019s March on Washington: a disembodied woman\u2019s face, split down the middle in positive and negative exposures, with the now-iconic phrase \u201cYour body is a battleground\u201d inscribed in white text on a red background. She created the work\u2014\u201csimultaneously art and protest\u201d\u2014in response to a wave of anti-abortion legislation, notes the Broad Museum of Art. \u201cThough its origin is tied to a specific moment, the power of the work lies in the timelessness of its declaration,\u201d the Broad adds. Barbara Kruger, Untitled (Forever), 2017 Amorepacific Museum of Art (APMA), Seoul \/ Photo by Timo Ohler and courtesy of Spr\u00fcth Magers Kruger\u2019s choice to display art in public spaces outside the museum also constitutes a political statement, as Megan O\u2019Grady wrote for the New York Times Style magazine in October 2020. \u201c[Her] work is nearly always direct in address and billboard-speed in receptivity,\u201d O\u2019Grady explained. \u201cResolutely anti-hierarchical, the artist\u2019s provocations have appeared on coffee mugs and city buses \u2026 thus ensuring that even people who might never have entered a museum or gallery would have access to them: medium, message, place.\u201d \u201cThinking of You.

Mexican Government A new exhibition marking the 200th anniversary of Mexico\u2019s independence from Spain features 1,525 pre-Hispanic artifacts, more than half of which were reclaimed from other countries. Titled \u201cThe Greatness of Mexico,\u201d the show marks the first time many of the items have been displayed in their home country. \u201cWhat is being gained here is the possibility for us Mexicans to see these pieces again, or even to see them for the first time,\u201d Miguel Angel Trinidad, one of the exhibition\u2019s curators, tells the Associated Press (AP). Foreign collectors returned some of the items voluntarily. Authorities seized others. The 881 items recovered from abroad were previously held in the United States, Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Outside of these artifacts, many of which were exported illegally, the show features pieces retrieved from warehouses in Mexico or seized within the country. A few dozen objects are on loan from museums abroad. The objects on display span more than 4,000 years of history. Mexican Government The show includes art and artifacts from the Maya, Toltec, Teotihuac\u00e1n, Aztec and Mixtec cultures, reports Cristina S\u00e1nchez Reyes for Agencia EFE. Items are on display at two venues: the National Museum of Anthropology and the Ibero-American Room in the Secretariat of Public Education headquarters, both in Mexico City. \u201c[M]any Mexicos exist,\u201d curator Karina Romero tells Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a melting pot, but instead a cultural mosaic that forms this country.\u201d As Jorge Islas L\u00f3pez, Mexico\u2019s consul general in New York, writes for El Universal, the objects span more than 4,000 years of history. Along with sculptures, vessels and other artifacts from varied pre-Hispanic contexts, the show features more recent work, including murals by Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and Rufino Tamayo. Also on display are banners flown by Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Miguel Hidalgo, the priest whose Cry of Dolores helped kick off the national independence movement in 1810. \u201cIt is an exhibition that brings together, in quantity and quality, various artistic manifestations that are part of our ancient history and of the moments in which we became a nation-state,\u201d Islas notes. The artwork represents numerous pre-Hispanic civilizations. Mexican Government Among the items on view are several famous codices, or manuscripts made by the Aztecs and their descendants during the pre-Hispanic and colonial periods. The Boturini Codex, a volume created by an anonymous Aztec writer between 1530 and 1541, details the Aztecs\u2019 history, including their establishment of the city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. The Cruz-Badiano Codex offers information on plants and their medicinal and spiritual uses, while a replica of the Codex Mendoza, created for Holy Roman Emperor Charles V around 1541, chronicles Aztec rulers and their conquests. \u201cThe Greatness of Mexico\u201d opened on September 27, the 200th anniversary of the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence and Spain\u2019s acceptance of Mexican sovereignty. The exhibition is part of a series of events commemorating that date, as well as the 500th anniversary of the fall of Tenochtitl\u00e1n to the Spanish in 1521. At an opening event for the show, Culture Minister Alejandra Frausto Guerrero said that between December 2018 and September 2021, 5,746 artifacts were repatriated to Mexico, per Ben Wein of Mexico News Daily. In recent months, Mexican officials have been working to repatriate more historical objects. In May, they unsuccessfully pushed Sotheby\u2019s to cancel a New York auction of masks, pottery vessels and stone carvings. In September, authorities tried to prevent another auction in Germany, also without success. Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

But Haaning says he has no plans to repay the cash. Kunsten Museum of Modern Art in Aalborg When staff at the Kunsten Museum of Modern Art in Aalborg loaned artist Jens Haaning 534,000 Danish krone (the equivalent of $84,000), they expected him to create a new version of a previous artwork in which he framed a large amount of cash to illustrate the difference between annual income in Denmark and Austria.

According to Euronews\u2019 Tom Bateman, a museum spokesperson says the institution has a written agreement with Haaning that the money must be returned when the exhibition ends on January 16, 2022. But the artist tells Danish radio program P1Morgen that he has no plans to repay the cash. \u201cThe work is that I have taken their money,\u201d he says. Haaning adds that he drew inspiration from the pay Kunsten offered for the artwork. Per Euronews, his contract included a display fee of about $1,550 and reimbursement for expenses up to $6,960. Haaning tells P1 he would have had to spend roughly $3,900 of his own money on the work. The museum hung the blank canvases as part of its \"Work it Out\" Exhibition.

It also posted his email explaining the work. \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a performance [piece],\u201d Andersson tells the Art Newspaper. According to P1, Haaning is well known in Denmark for such works as reproducing the nation\u2019s flag in green and moving a car dealership and a massage clinic into exhibition buildings. The work is that I have taken their money. \u201cWork It Out,\u201d which opened on September 24, focuses on the nature of work and the potential to make working life sustainable for individuals and society. Among the other artworks on display are an interactive meeting room by Kenneth Balfelt Team \/\/ Johan August, a photo and video installation by Adelita Husni-Bey examining the working conditions of nurses, and a sculpture by Josh Klein consisting of a FedEx parcel containing reproductions of the severed lower arms of delivery men. \u201cWe spend a lot of our waking hours going to work, but perhaps too little time wondering what work really is,\u201d says Dennis N\u00f8rmark, an anthropologist and member of the exhibition\u2019s visionary board, on the museum\u2019s website. \u201cWe think we know, but it crumbles for many of us when we try to define it.\u201d In a statement quoted by CBS News\u2019 Caitlin O\u2019Kane, Haaning explains that his canvases are also a reflection on working life. \u201cThe artwork is essentially about the working conditions of artists,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a statement saying that we also have the responsibility of questioning the structures that we are part of. And if these structures are completely unreasonable, we must break with them. It can be your marriage, your work\u2014it can be any type of societal structure.\u201d Nonetheless, Andersson tells the Art Newspaper that the museum does expect Haaning to return the money, which it planned to use for the building\u2019s upkeep. \u201cWe are not a rich museum,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are really hoping the money will come back.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Pictured here is Albrecht D\u00fcrer's 1508 chalk sketch of an unidentified African man. Albertine Dijkema \/ Rijksmuseum Portraits, particularly the commissioned likenesses that were all the rage in Renaissance Europe, open windows into the most intimate desires, fears and hopes of both the sitter and the artist who painted them. How did this person wish to be seen? How did the artist want the individual to be remembered in life and after death? These questions surely weighed on the minds of the more than 100 people depicted in the Rijksmuseum\u2019s new exhibition, \u201cRemember Me.\u201d Curated by Matthias Ubl, Sara van Dijk and Friso Lammertse, the Amsterdam show unites dozens of Renaissance-era portraits of noblemen, middle-class families, children, soldiers, artists and more, rendered by the likes of German artists Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Hans Holbein, as well as renowned Italian painters such as Sofonisba Anguissola and Titian. Per a statement, \u201cRemember Me\u201d opens on October 1 and runs through January 16, 2022. Anyone with an internet connection can explore the exhibition\u2019s accompanying online resources, which feature in-depth explorations of several key works. Titian, Portrait of Ranuccio Farnese, circa 1541\u201342 National Gallery of Art, Samuel H. Kress Collection Portraiture blossomed in 16th-century Europe, spurred in part by a wealthy class of elites eager to demonstrate their influence through art. A featured portrait of an unknown man by Sicilian artist Antonello da Messina, for instance, communicates the wealthy sitter\u2019s confidence through his posture and serious gaze, according to the museum. The exhibition also unites two of the earliest individual portraits of African men in the history of European art. These works are being exhibited together for the first time, reports Daniel Boffey for the Guardian. One of the images is a 1508 chalk portrait of an unidentified Black man by D\u00fcrer. The German artist probably made the work for himself and kept the portrait in his studio, where it was discovered after his death. (Though it\u2019s not included in this show, D\u00fcrer also sketched a 1521 portrait of Katharina, a 20-year-old servant of African descent who worked in the home of a Portuguese businessman, writes historian Jeff Bowersox for Black Central Europe.) Later, around 1525, Flemish artist Jan Jansz Mostaert painted Portrait of an African Man, a small oil likeness of a bearded Black man in military attire. The sitter elected to pose with his chin pointed upward, in a position of authority, while wearing fashionable, costly attire that suggests he held a role in court. The work stands out as the \u201cearliest known painted portrait of an individual African man in late medieval and Renaissance Europe,\u201d per the statement. Mostaert rendered his subject\u2019s facial characteristics \u201ctrue to life\u201d in specific detail, indicating that the sitter was a real person who commissioned the work rather than a figment of the artist\u2019s imagination or a typified character study, as was sometimes the case with other early European depictions of African people, curator Ubl tells the Guardian. Though the sitter\u2019s identity remains unknown, Ubl says the golden badge on the man\u2019s hat suggests he could have been Christophle le More, an archer and personal bodyguard to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The seal emphasizes the sitter\u2019s Christian faith, telling viewers that that he completed a pilgrimage to Halle, a destination popular with members of the Brussels court. Jan Jansz Mostaert, Portrait of an African Man (Christophle le More?), circa 1525\u201330 Rijksmuseum The inclusion of portraits of African people aligns with the Rijksmuseum\u2019s desire to explore the legacies of colonialism through its collections, building on a recent exhibition about slavery in Dutch colonies, reports Mike Corder for the Associated Press (AP). Whitewashing of Renaissance history has led many to assume that 15th- and 16th-century Europe was racially and ethnically homogenous. But this was far from the case, as people from African and European communities traded with one another and intermingled, particularly in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cThere was a presence in the Renaissance ... of Africans in Europe and we felt it very important to show these two works, to also show that presence,\u201d Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits tells the AP. \u201cI think that for a long time in the history of art, these works were invisible.\u201d Petrus Christus, Portrait of a Young Girl, 1470 Gem\u00e4ldegalerie der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin Other notable works on display include Petrus Christus\u2019 famed Portrait of a Young Girl (circa 1470), which has only left its home at Berlin\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie one other time in the past six decades, reports J.S. Marcus for the Art Newspaper. Scholars know little about the girl\u2019s identity, but Christus\u2019 small oil-on-panel work has long drawn praise for the arresting gaze of its sitter and its layered background, which places the subject in a three-dimensional space, write art historians Steven Zucker and Beth Harris for Smarthistory. Another intimate painting in the show is Dirck Jacobsz\u2019s likeness of his father, fellow artist Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen. Painted in 1533, shortly after the latter\u2019s death, the portrait is one of the earliest known images of a painter at an easel. Jacobsz depicts his late father at work on a portrait of his wife (and Jacobsz\u2019s mother), Anna. \u201c[R]ather than a self-portrait,\u201d the artist thus creates a composition inflected with grief and loss\u2014\u201ca portrait of a family: father, mother and son,\u201d the Rijksmuseum notes. A second early depiction of an artist at their easel is Anguissola\u2019s Self-Portrait, which she painted around 1556 or 1557. Born to a relatively poor Italian noble family, Anguissola was one of the few women of her era who managed to break through the ranks in a mostly male field. Sofonisba Anguissola, Self-Portrait, circa 1556\u201357 Lancut Castle Museum In the Rijksmuseum portrait, the painter depicts herself in a simple outfit. Religious paintings were generally considered a \u201chigher\u201d art form than portraits at the time, so Anguissola pointedly depicts herself at work on a scene of the Virgin Mary and Christ, according to the museum. The artist\u2019s firm gaze holds the viewer\u2019s eyes and leaves no doubt as to her intended message: Anguissola considers herself just as serious\u2014and capable\u2014as her male peers. \u201cRemember Me\u201d is on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam from October 1 to January 16, 2022.

Consulado General de M\u00e9xico en Nueva York via Facebook Thanks to a group of eagle-eyed scholars, a trove of stolen colonial-era documents has been returned to Mexico City. Unidentified thieves smuggled the 16th-century papers out of Mexico\u2019s Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n (AGN) in a \u201csystematic,\u201d multi-year operation, reports Ra\u00fal Cort\u00e9s Fern\u00e1ndez for Reuters. Researchers first raised concerns about the possible heist after noticing some of the archive\u2019s documents inexplicably appearing at auction in 2017. Most of the manuscripts have direct links to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, leader of the Spanish forces that invaded the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, waged war against the region\u2019s Indigenous peoples and launched the colonization of modern-day Mexico. American authorities returned the documents in a ceremony held at the Mexican consulate in New York City last Thursday, per a statement posted on Facebook. As Adyr Corral reports for Mexican newspaper Milenio, the cache of stolen goods includes 15 handwritten papers, as well as a small collection of looted antiquities that the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office recovered over the course of its investigation. \u201cThis is one of the most important recoveries of documents in the history of Mexico,\u201d said Mexican foreign affairs minister Marcelo Ebrard at the Thursday event, per Milenio (as translated via Google Translate).Documentos hist\u00f3ricos del siglo XVI, incluyendo Carta de Hernan Cort\u00e9s, recuperados por la oficina del Fiscal General de Nueva York y Home Land Investigations.

(@m_ebrard) September 23, 2021 The pages were cut from their original binding, smuggled out of the archive and illegally sold through such major auction houses as Christie\u2019s and Bonhams. They garnered tens of thousands of dollars at auction, notes Rosa Vilchis for Noticieros Televisa. Academics initially raised questions about the auctioned items\u2019 provenance in 2017. The lots\u2014royal decrees, legal records and even a rare letter bearing Cort\u00e9s\u2019 own signature\u2014looked suspiciously similar to documents that were supposed to be held in the Mexico City archive, as Drazen Jorgic and Cort\u00e9s reported for Reuters in May. Among the experts who noticed the discrepancies were philologist Michel Oudijk and historian Sebasti\u00e1n van Doesburg, both from the National Autonomous University of Mexico; Mar\u00eda Isabel Gra\u00f1\u00e9n Porr\u00faa, a Mexican scholar of colonial history; Rodrigo Martinez Baracs, a historian at Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology (INAH); and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00ednez of the University of Valladolid in Spain. The group contacted Mexican authorities in 2018 and 2019 but received little response. Then, the scholars took matters into their own hands, launching an amateur investigation that identified at least ten papers from AGN\u2019s Cort\u00e9s collections that had been auctioned off in the United States. Researchers compared images from auction listings to AGN microfilm records and other sources. Mart\u00ednez even employed photos of manuscripts that she\u2019d taken on research trips to the archive in 2010 and 2014. We are very worried, not just by this theft, but also about all the other robberies and looting of national heritage. News of the string of thefts finally made headlines in September 2020, when New York\u2013based Swann Auction Galleries announced plans to sell a 1521 royal order addressed to Cort\u00e9s and Pedro de Alvarado, who was identified as the mayor of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, per Mexico News Daily. Historians voiced their concerns and halted the sale of the document, prompting Mexican and U.S. authorities to launch a formal investigation into the fates of the other documents, as Spanish news service Agencia EFE reported in May. Housed in a gargantuan former prison in Mexico City, the national archive has been plagued by allegations of theft and lax security for years, notes Elizabeth Mistry for the Art Newspaper. Speaking with Lauren Villagran of the El Paso Times last October, Oudijk said, \u201cAny researcher who has been there and reads this story will say, \u2018It\u2019s an inside job.\u2019\u201d Michael Swanton, a linguist at the National Autonomous University, added, \u201cObviously, the person who was doing this had some idea of what they were looking at. Obviously, the person is part of a network to bring them to New York City, and somebody knew to subdivide them to different auction houses.\u201d The confirmed thefts are \u201cscandalous,\u201d Porr\u00faa told Reuters in May. \u201cWe are very worried, not just by this theft, but also about all the other robberies and looting of national heritage.\u201d Per the Art Newspaper, current AGN director Carlos Ru\u00edz described the thefts as a \u201cwholesale pillaging of the National Archive for commercial gain.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Paul Vu \/ Brooklyn Museum \/ Dior In the aftermath of World War II, French fashion designer Christian Dior spearheaded a new era of style with his extravagant, ultrafeminine creations. Now, writes Miles Pope for Vanity Fair, a new exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in New York is chronicling the House of Dior\u2019s 75-year history, \u201cmasterfully blend[ing its founder\u2019s] artistry and legacy.\u201d Titled \u201cChristian Dior: Designer of Dreams,\u201d the 22,000-square-foot show features more than 200 haute couture garments, photographs, videos, sketches, accessories and other items, some of which are on public display for the first time. As Hamish Bowles reports for Vogue, \u201cDesigner of Dreams\u201d features garments by both Dior and his successors at the fashion house, including Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, John Galliano, Raf Simons and current artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri. For the new exhibition, curators converted the museum\u2019s Beaux-Arts Court into something straight out of the pages of Vogue. Designs on view \u201cexemplify ... the French couturier\u2019s fabled silhouettes, including his groundbreaking \u2018New Look,\u2019 which debuted in 1947,\u201d according to a statement. \u201c... The exhibition also brings to life Dior\u2019s many sources of inspiration\u2014from the splendor of flowers and other natural forms to classical and contemporary art.\u201d In addition to tracing the brand\u2019s evolution, \u201cDesigner of Dreams\u201d includes dresses inspired by 18th-century fashions, a \u201ccolorama\u201d display of Dior accessories and a gallery outlining Dior\u2019s dressmaking process. Compared with the original version of the show, which debuted at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris in 2017, the New York iteration is more focused on the present, dedicating a significant amount of space to Chiuri\u2019s creations. Christian Dior's 1947 bar suit, afternoon ensemble with an ecru natural shantung jacket and black pleated wool crepe skirt \u00a9 Katerina Jebb \/ Brooklyn Museum \u201cChiuri is, of course, the first woman to helm Dior, which is a big deal, but the exhibit doesn\u2019t really explore what that means beyond ... catchphrases\u201d like \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists and \u201cWould God Be Female,\u201d writes fashion critic Vanessa Friedman for the New York Times. In Paris, Friedman adds, \u201cI actually learned something about Dior the man, who started his career as a gallerist. And it was convincing in presenting the way he established the vocabulary of the house: the extravagant yet trim femininity of the \u2018New Look\u2019; his lush color palette; his fascination with flowers, filigree and tarot.\u201d Born into an affluent family in Granville, France, in 1905, Dior was one of the leading designers of the 20th century. He trained under couturiers Robert Piguet and Lucien Lelong before establishing his own fashion house in 1946. Over the next several years, Dior developed his trademark \u201cNew Look,\u201d which featured lower waistlines, smaller shoulders, defined waists and voluminous skirts\u2014a marked departure from wartime padded shoulders and short skirts. \u201cWhat was heralded as a new style was merely the genuine, natural expression of the kind of fashion I wanted to see,\u201d the designer once said. \u201cIt just so happened that my personal inclinations coincided with the general mood for the times and thus became the fashion watchword. It was as if Europe had tired of dropping bombs and now wanted to let off a few fireworks.\u201d Writing for Deutsche Welle in 2017, Jan Tomes argued that Dior\u2019s vision of \u201cradical femininity\u201d appealed to the postwar public\u2019s sense of nostalgia. He \u201cdidn\u2019t want to create everyday clothes for the pragmatic woman of the fast-moving century but rather sell a dream of the good old days, when women could afford to be extravagant and deliberately glamorous.\u201d Here and Now Agency Dior\u2019s relatively conservative designs attracted criticism from those who accused him of \u201ctaking away women\u2019s newly attained independence by lacing them up in corsets and making them wear long skirts again,\u201d per Deutsche Welle. As fashion designer Coco Chanel commented, \u201cDior doesn\u2019t dress women. He upholsters them!\u201d Despite these critiques, Dior\u2019s designs remained immensely popular both during his lifetime (he died of a heart attack in 1957) and in the decades after. But the fashion house\u2019s legacy isn\u2019t limited to its founder, Chiuri tells Booth Moore of Women\u2019s Wear Daily. She adds, \u201cI hope people see how the history of the brand was shaped by so many, because sometimes when we speak about Dior, we don\u2019t realize how many designers worked at this brand, and it\u2019s very important because it\u2019s not only the history of Mr. Dior, but also Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan and John Galliano.\u201d \u201cChristian Dior: Designer of Dreams\u201d is on view at the Brooklyn Museum in New York through February 20, 2022.

Dave MacLeod \/ Historic England From Roman ruins to Cold War bunkers, England is home to countless hidden archaeological landscapes spanning thousands of years. Now, writes Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian, an interactive map published by Historic England allows users to take \u201cvirtual flights\u201d over these treasures of the past. Researchers used more than 500,000 aerial photographs captured over the past 30 years, as well as 3-D laser scans, to piece together a digital mosaic described by Historic England as \u201ca huge archaeological jigsaw puzzle.\u201d The online map features heritage sites covering more than half of the country, reports Alexa Fox for the Northern Echo. \u201cThis new aerial archaeology mapping tool lets people fly virtually over England and drink in its many layers of history,\u201d says Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, in a statement. \u201cIt will allow everyone to explore the hidden heritage of their local places and what makes them special.\u201d Per the statement, the new tool\u2014officially titled the Aerial Archaeology Mapping Explorer\u2014allows history lovers to view archaeological features \u201cnot just as individual sites, but as part of complex, multi-period landscapes.\u201d Researchers used aerial photography and LiDAR surveys to create a 3-D map of England's historical landscape. Damian Grady \/ Historic England Listings include an amalgam of historical periods, from 6,000 years ago to the 20th century. Highlights include prehistoric hillforts, medieval farming sites with furrows made by ancient plowing, coal-mining operations from the 18th and 19th centuries, encampments and coastal defenses used during the First and Second World Wars, and Cold War structures. According to BBC News, the map also shows Iron Age and Roman farms in Yorkshire. Experts identified the ruins after spotting \u201ccropmarks\u201d\u2014patterns formed in fields when crops are affected by buried archaeological features\u2014during an aerial survey in 2006. Similar surveys conducted by Historic England have yielded extensive maps and images of ancient sites dotted across the country, including Hadrian\u2019s Wall, a Roman fortification built in the second century C.E. to keep out marauding Gaelic warriors from what is now Scotland. Imagery of Yorkshire Dales National Park, meanwhile, reveals remains of settlements dating back to the prehistoric period, as well as mineshafts from the post-medieval era. Other sites featured on the portal range from Bronze Age round barrows to camps, settlements and field systems representing several millennia of activity. This screenshot from the Aerial Archeology Mapping Explorer shows two Roman camps near White Moss in Cumbria. Historic England Recent light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys of Wallingford Estate, a sprawling preserve in Northumberland maintained by the National Trust, show historic farming systems, gardens and Iron Age settlements, as well as former areas of woodland. The scans were taken ahead of the replanting of 75,000 native trees at Wallingford. \u201cThis is an exciting moment in the 5,000-year history of this special estate,\u201d says archaeologist Mark Newman in a National Trust statement. \u201c... All these discoveries will be investigated further to ensure none are impacted by the upcoming planting plans and to preserve their archaeology for future study.\u201d Each site included in the Historic England map includes a description with links to historic environment records, as well as reports about highlights and new discoveries. The government agency is continuing to map other regions and make more detailed analyses of known sites to see what new history might be uncovered. \u201cWe hope it will give people a springboard to further investigation, whether for research purposes or simply to satisfy curiosity about what archaeological features they may have noticed around their local area,\u201d says Wilson in the Historic England statement.

Directorate of Gallipoli Historic Site Ready to take a deep dive into history\u2014literally? Scuba divers can now explore the hulks of British and French ships sunk off the coast of Turkey during World War I\u2019s Gallipoli Campaign. Tourism officials have transformed the century-old wrecks in the Dardanelles Strait into a \u201cmuseum under the sea,\u201d reports Diego Cupolo for the London Times. The ships sank in 1915, when Ottoman and Allied forces faced off on the Gallipoli peninsula\u2014a deadly victory by the Central Powers that would impact the lives of future world leaders Winston Churchill and Mustafa Kemal. The Gallipoli Historic Underwater Park opened this month near the Turkish seaport of Canakkale, next to the ancient Greek ruins of Troy. Visitors can dive to the wrecks of 14 warships, including the HMS Majestic, a 421-foot British battleship that was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 27, 1915.\u201cIt\u2019s like a time machine that takes you back to 1915 and World War I,\u201d diver and documentary maker Savas Karakas tells Fulya Ozerkan of Agence-France Presse (AFP). View of sunken ship at the Gallipoli Historic Underwater Park Directorate of Gallipoli Historic Site Some of the wrecks are in relatively shallow waters of less than 25 feet. Others are deeper at around 60 to 100 feet. One sunken ship\u2014HMS Triumph\u2014rests 230 feet below the surface. Yusuf Kartal, an official with Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, tells TRT World\u2019s Karya Naz Balkiz that the underwater park is \u201ca different world.\u201d He adds, \u201cYou see the submerged ship[s] as they were 106 years ago and experience the chaos of war secondhand.\u201d Despite the continued threat posed by unexploded mines and ordnance, Turkish authorities decided to open the area to divers. (\u201cIn the whole Dardanelles we have many thousands\u201d of live torpedoes, Kartal says to Joshua Hammer of the New York Times; most \u201crequire a serious jolt to detonate.\u201d) The government\u2019s decision\u2014and the broader practice of diving to wartime shipwrecks\u2014has drawn criticism from those who consider the sunken vessels military graveyards, the London Times reports. Plans to turn the wrecks into an underwater park took shape in 2017, following the centennial of the 1915\u201316 campaign. Officials had hoped to open the park this summer but were forced to delay until October by the resurging Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThere was history and treasure lying underwater for more than 100 years,\u201d Ismail Kasdemir, head of the Canakkale Historical Site, tells AFP. \u201cThe diving community was curious.\u201d The HMS Majestic sank on May 27, 1915. Royal Navy via Wikimedia Commons under public domain Though British and French troops landed on Gallipoli on February 17, 1915, actual combat did not begin until April 25. The Allies planned to march up the peninsula, capture Constantinople (now Istanbul) and open a path to the Black Sea that would give Russia access to the Mediterranean Sea. Conceived by Churchill, then first lord of the admiralty, the operation\u2019s bitter trench warfare resulted in massive casualties on both sides. The Allies abandoned the campaign 11 months later, in January 1916, and the disgraced Churchill retreated from politics for nearly 20 years. He would return to office in 1940, leading Great Britain to victory in World War II as prime minister. The Allies\u2019 failure at Gallipoli owed much to Ottoman commander Kemal, who succeeded in preventing British and French forces from advancing past their beachheads in several key battles. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Kemal helped establish the Republic of Turkey as a secular state and adopted the surname of Atat\u00fcrk, or \u201cFather Turk.\u201d Today, residents of Turkey view the Ottoman victory at Gallipoli as a defining moment for the end of the empire and the birth of a new nation.

He had high hopes for the artwork, believing that it would serve as his ticket into the Parisian art market. But the painting\u2019s reception was negative, even scathing. \u201cYou can do better than this,\u201d wrote Anthon van Rappard, a fellow painter and friend of van Gogh, in a letter. Now, reports Daniel Boffey for the Guardian, a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is inviting visitors to carefully consider The Potato Eaters, which the artist continued to hold in high regard despite the criticism against it. Later, during a period of personal crisis, van Gogh actually made plans to work on a second version of the painting. \u201cHe is very, very convinced of the power of his work and the message it conveys,\u201d says curator Bregje Gerritse to Bruno Waterfield of the London Times. Vincent van Gogh, Hand With a Stick, and Four People Sharing a Meal, March\u2013April 1885, chalk on paper Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation \u201cThe Potato Eaters: Mistake or Masterpiece?\u201d features around 50 paintings, drawings, sketches and letters that tell the story of van Gogh\u2019s rustic supper scene. He began working on The Potato Eaters while living with his parents in Nuenen, a rural town in the Netherlands that was home to many farmers, laborers and weavers. It was the perfect place to capture peasant life, a subject of interest to van Gogh and many of his contemporaries. Per a statement, the exhibition includes 10 of the 40 studies of peasants\u2019 faces that van Gogh created over the span of a single winter, among them a portrait of Gordina de Groot, who appears in The Potato Eaters. Van Gogh hoped to prove himself as a figure painter, but he had little experience painting full-length portraits. The peasant meal was a popular theme among artists at the time, and it allowed van Gogh to depict his subjects sitting down. Uncharacteristically, he created many preliminary studies for The Potato Eaters, visiting the de Groot cottage repeatedly to capture the family as they ate their evening meal. He sketched out small details\u2014a clock, a spoon rack, a chunk of bread, a hand on a teapot\u2014to prepare for the painting. The final result shows five people gathered around a table, eating potatoes and drinking coffee. The figures are painted in earth tones\u2014\u201csomething like the color of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course,\u201d as the artist once reflected. Their hands are gnarled from hard work, their faces bony, their eyes dark and expressive. Unlike other painters of the same subject, van Gogh did not idealize peasant life. According to the Van Gogh Museum, he wanted to convey that the family members \u201chave tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food.\u201d Despite van Gogh\u2019s hard work and his ambitions for The Potato Eaters, the painting was not featured in an exhibition during the artist\u2019s lifetime. In fact, writes Waterfield for the Times, it was \u201cgreeted by almost universal disapproval.\u201d Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh with sketch of a head of a woman (Gordina de Groot), circa May 28, 1885 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation The withering letter from van Rappard exemplifies critical disdain for the painting\u2019s technical execution. \u201c[W]hy may that man on the right not have a knee or a belly or lungs?\u201d he chastised. \u201cOr are they in his back? And why must his arm be a meter too short? And why must he lack half of his nose? \u2026 Art is too important, it seems to me, to be treated so cavalierly.\u201d This review must have been particularly devastating to van Gogh because, as the Guardian points out, he struggled with group compositions\u2014a genre of which van Rappard was a master. Van Gogh sent the letter back to his friend with a response defending The Potato Eaters, in which he argued that van Rappard had missed the essence of the painting: \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to get with it is to be able to draw not a hand but the gesture, not a mathematically correct head but the overall expression. The sniffing of the wind when a digger looks up, say, or speaking. Life, in short.\u201d The Potato Eaters continued to linger in van Gogh\u2019s mind, even after he moved to France and perfected a markedly different\u2014and now iconic\u2014style defined by bright colors and loose brushwork. In April 1889, following a mental health crisis, van Gogh asked to be admitted to an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence in the south of France. During this period of confinement, he started planning a new version of The Potato Eaters, writing in a letter that the \u201ccanvas must be completely dark now, perhaps I could redo it entirely from memory.\u201d Vincent van Gogh, Study for The Potato Eaters, April 1885 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam \/ Vincent van Gogh Foundation Van Gogh made preparatory sketches for the second version, including an 1890 drawing of five figures clustered around a table. This work, along with several other preliminary sketches, are featured in the new exhibition. \u201cSome of these are drawings that have not been on display for such a long time that our records even suggest they were never shown,\u201d Gerritse tells the Guardian. The artist never carried out his plans for a second Potato Eaters. In late July 1890, with his mental health spiraling, the artist shot himself in the chest. He died two days later. Today, The Potato Eaters is considered one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous works\u2014a vindication of his claim that the painting was \u201cthe best thing I did.\u201d Gerritse says contemporary observers can see the artist\u2019s fortitude in his commitment to this masterpiece. \u201cI really like that van Gogh stands behind his own work,\u201d the curator tells the Guardian. \u201cHe says there is a certain life in it, writing that while, of course, there are technical mistakes but that technical perfection isn\u2019t what he is after; it is the impression that it conveys about peasant life that is much more important.\u201d \u201cThe Potato Eaters: Mistake or Masterpiece?\u201d is on view at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam through February 13, 2022.

Intrigued, he drops two more cones into the river, and then another two\u2014this time a big one and a small one so he can try to guess which will appear first on the opposite side of the bridge. \u201cAnd that was the beginning of the game called Poohsticks, which Pooh invented,\u201d Milne writes, \u201cand which he and his friends used to play on the edge of the Forest. But they played with sticks instead of fir-cones, because they were easier to mark.\u201d The place where Pooh and his lovable band of buddies played their game was inspired by a real bridge in Ashdown Forest, the heathland in southeast England where Milne purchased a country home for his family in 1924. Known as Poohsticks Bridge, the literary landmark is now up for auction, reports Theresa Waldrop for CNN. Built in 1907, the structure was originally called Posingford Bridge. It served as a river crossing for pedestrians, carts and horses, according to auction house Summers Place. Milne\u2019s son, Christopher Robin\u2014who lends his name to Pooh\u2019s human companion\u2014came upon the bridge during one of his jaunts through Ashdown Forest, the bucolic inspiration for Hundred Acre Wood, which Pooh and his friends call home. Poohsticks is attributed to the silly old bear in Milne\u2019s stories, but it was the author and his son who actually invented the game as they played together on Posingford Bridge. \u201cI first found the bridge 20 years after it had been built when I came upon it with my nanny,\u201d Christopher later said, as quoted by the Guardian\u2019s Nikki Knewstub. \u201cHow could we not fall in love with it? Then my parents came and how could they not fall in love with it?\u201d Milne\u2019s first Winnie-the-Pooh collection, published in 1926, was an instant hit both in England and abroad. The House at Pooh Corner, his second volume of Pooh stories, includes an illustration of Posingford Bridge by E.H. Shepard, who created iconic sketches of scenes from Milne\u2019s work. The bridge subsequently became a destination for fans of Pooh, who flocked there to play their own games of Poohsticks. Christopher officially renamed the structure \u201cPoohsticks Bridge\u201d during a ceremony in 1979, according to Anita Singh of the Telegraph. Of course, Pooh is global, but at the same time he is a very English creation. Years of foot traffic took their toll on the landmark, which by 1999 was so worn down that it was taken apart and stored at the Ashdown Forest Center. A new bridge was put in its place, funded by local groups and the Disney Corporation, which acquired the rights to Pooh in 1961. But the area\u2019s parish council recently allowed two anonymous buyers to purchase and rebuild the original. Local oak was used to replace any missing parts, and the fully restored bridge is now available for purchase. \u201cThe dismantled bridge lay neglected for years until these two enterprising guys acquired it,\u201d James Rylands, director of Summers Place, tells the Telegraph. The sellers, he adds, are \u201cquite happy\u201d to rebuild the bridge if it needs to be taken apart during transport. Some observers have expressed concern that Poohsticks Bridge will be sold to a buyer outside of England, much like Christopher\u2019s childhood toys, which gave rise to Milne\u2019s stories and are now held by the New York Public Library. \u201cOf course, Pooh is global, but at the same time he is a very English creation,\u201d British broadcaster and teddy bear aficionado Gyles Brandreth tells the Telegraph. Others are more pragmatic. \u201cIt was a pile of old junk wood that nobody wanted\u2014and if somebody has made something of it and can sell it as a bit of Winnie-the-Pooh history, good luck to them,\u201d an unnamed local said to the Telegraph. All bids for the bridge, which is expected to sell for between $54,000 and $81,000, are due today. Wherever it ends up, Poohsticks Bridge is now whole again\u2014and perhaps it can be used once more as a place to play on a \u201cpeaceful sort of day,\u201d just as Milne and his son (and Pooh) used to do.

But what they\u2019re actually seeing is a work of art masquerading as an advert (or vice versa)\u2014one of many Barbara Kruger creations splashed onto billboards, bus stops and storefronts as part of a major exhibition now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC). \u201cThinking of You. I Mean Me. I Mean You.\u201d runs through January 24 before traveling to two co-organizing institutions: the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The artist\u2019s biggest survey to date, the show spills over into the streets of Chicago, underscoring Kruger\u2019s signature appropriation of the visual language of tabloids, advertisements and other mass media. For previous shows, Kruger has designed MetroCards, wrapped a Manhattan city bus in quotes from famous figures and painted the Pledge of Allegiance on a warehouse in L.A.\u2019s Little Tokyo neighborhood. Now, she\u2019s transforming Chicago into her personal canvas, decorating everything from storefronts along Michigan Avenue to the stairs and exterior windows of the Art Institute building itself. (Those interested in locating all of Kruger\u2019s work within and around the museum grounds can peruse a map here.) Barbara Kruger, Untitled (Truth), 2013 Collection of Margaret and Daniel S. Loeb \/ Digital image courtesy of the artist In rare, site-specific works of immense scale, curators painstakingly covered the museum\u2019s 18,000-square-foot Regenstein Hall and 8,000-square-foot Griffin Court atrium with vinyl prints of Kruger\u2019s work. (\u201cIn the 33 years since Regenstein Hall was built, this is the first time we have covered the entire floor,\u201d notes project manager Courtney Smith in an AIC blog post.) Workers also installed speakers throughout the museum to project Kruger\u2019s immersive sound installations. Over her four-decade career, Kruger has continually blurred the distinction between commercialism and art. Even those unfamiliar with her work will almost certainly recognize the artist\u2019s distinctive white text, emblazoned on red or black backgrounds in the sans serif font Futura, writes Kyle MacMillan for the Chicago Sun-Times. Barbara Kruger, Thinking of You. I Mean Me. I Mean You., 2019 Digital image courtesy of the artist The exhibition includes works from throughout Kruger\u2019s career, some of which have been reworked specifically for the show. Several of the artist\u2019s trademark images are reinterpreted as video works on enormous L.E.D. screens in the galleries, per the Sun-Times. These reimagined works include Untitled (I shop therefore I am) (1987\/2019), which references an older body of work about mass culture and consumerism. \u201cI would not call [this exhibition] a retrospective,\u201d Kruger tells Julie Baumgardner of Artnet News. \u201c[I]t\u2019s a conflation of new works and renovations of older works and changing them.\u201d The artist adds that the show\u2019s unusual title, which must be formatted with strikethroughs in place, refers to \u201cour own ego constructions, our narratives, our ability to speak and listen, our investment in our voice, or others\u2014all those shifting positions.\u201d Barbara Kruger's Justice, 1997, depicts J. Edgar Hoover and Roy Cohn embracing. Courtesy of the artist, Spr\u00fcth Magers, and David Zwirner, New York \/ Photo courtesy of Mary Boone Gallery, New York Kruger\u2019s taste for simple fonts and bold images contrasts with the complex messages of her works, which \u201cundermine and expose the power dynamics of identity, desire and consumerism,\u201d per an AIC statement. Her best-known works employ pithy epigrams and images to arrest viewers\u2019 attention in humorous, thought-provoking and sometimes disconcerting ways. As Philip Kennicott writes for the Washington Post, the exhibition features a 1982 image by Kruger that overlays an image of Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel frescoes with the words \u201cYou invest in the divinity of the masterpiece.\u201d Its meaning is purposefully ambiguous, according to Kennicott: \u201cThe \u2018you\u2019 could refer to the art world, which traffics in art as a commodity while pretending it is somehow sacred or beyond ordinary terrestrial valuation.\u201d Or, he argues, Kruger could be poking fun at the \u201cart-loving tourist, who consumes energy and other resources only to stand before a painting and mutter meaningless platitudes about its divinity.\u201d Kruger designed one of her most famous images for the 1989 Women\u2019s March on Washington: a disembodied woman\u2019s face, split down the middle in positive and negative exposures, with the now-iconic phrase \u201cYour body is a battleground\u201d inscribed in white text on a red background. She created the work\u2014\u201csimultaneously art and protest\u201d\u2014in response to a wave of anti-abortion legislation, notes the Broad Museum of Art. \u201cThough its origin is tied to a specific moment, the power of the work lies in the timelessness of its declaration,\u201d the Broad adds. Barbara Kruger, Untitled (Forever), 2017 Amorepacific Museum of Art (APMA), Seoul \/ Photo by Timo Ohler and courtesy of Spr\u00fcth Magers Kruger\u2019s choice to display art in public spaces outside the museum also constitutes a political statement, as Megan O\u2019Grady wrote for the New York Times Style magazine in October 2020. \u201c[Her] work is nearly always direct in address and billboard-speed in receptivity,\u201d O\u2019Grady explained. \u201cResolutely anti-hierarchical, the artist\u2019s provocations have appeared on coffee mugs and city buses \u2026 thus ensuring that even people who might never have entered a museum or gallery would have access to them: medium, message, place.\u201d \u201cThinking of You.

Photo by Mehmet Emin Menguarslan \/ Anadolu Agency via Getty Images About 1,800 years ago, when Lucius attended a gladiatorial spectacle at an ancient amphitheater in what is now western Turkey, he knew exactly where to sit: After all, his name was inscribed in Greek on his very own VIP seat. Archaeologists found the word Lukios\u2014the Greek version of the Latin Lucius\u2014and other names engraved on special stone seating in the large arena, which was designed to look like Rome\u2019s Colosseum. They discovered this ancient equivalent of reserved \u201cbox seats\u201d while working at Pergamon, a Unesco World Heritage Site that once acted as the capital of the Attalid dynasty, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. \u201cThey wanted to build a replica of the Colosseum here, which was frequented by all segments of society,\u201d Felix Pirson, director of the Istanbul branch of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), tells Efsun Erbalaban Y\u0131lmaz of the state-run Anadolu Agency (AA). \u201cBut people from the upper class or important families had private seats in special sections with their names engraved on them.\u201d Excavations at the amphitheater have been ongoing since 2018. Photo by Mehmet Emin Menguarslan \/ Anadolu Agency via Getty Images According to Pirson, the researchers were caught off guard by the fact that the names carved on the chairs\u2019 large stone backs were Latin monikers written in Greek letters. Prior to its absorption by Rome in the first century B.C.E., Pergamon had been a prominent Greek city. \u201cWe believe that some people from Italy had a special place in the Pergamon amphitheater,\u201d the archaeologist tells AA. Located near the modern Turkish city of Bergama, the amphitheater housed at least 25,000 spectators (and perhaps as many as 50,000). It boasted five exclusive lodges, or cavea, reports the Hurriyet Daily News. These spaces likely served as luxury suites for elite guests, similar to private corporate areas found at modern sporting arenas. Excavations at the amphitheater began in 2018 as part of the Transformation of the Pergamon Micro-Region (TransPergMikro) project. Archaeologists from the DAI and the Technical University of the Institute of Architecture in Berlin consider the site significant because of its close resemblance to the Colosseum. Researchers think the structure was designed to compete with amphitheaters in Ephesus and Smyrna, two nearby cities that rose to prominence under Roman rule. Pergamon hosted gladiator and animal fights in the second century C.E., AA reports. The amphitheater was probably also used for public executions and reenactments of naval battles, as it was located on a waterway. \u201cSince this building was built between two slopes, separated by a stream which is transmitted via a vaulted water channel, it can be assumed that in the arena Naumachia (naval combat) or water games could be performed,\u201d notes the TransPergMicro website. Archaeologists used 3-D imaging to analyze the stone seats. They are currently trying to decipher the inscriptions. Lukios was one of the names that was easily identified, Pirson tells Smithsonian magazine. \u201cOur epigraphists are currently working on the names and we are still waiting for the results,\u201d he writes in an email. The seating blocks are now on view at the Red Basilica, a ruined temple in Bergama. Pirson and his team expect to display the rest of the discoveries at the Pergamon Museum in \u0130zmir later this year. David Kindy | | READ MORE David Kindy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Photo by Stefano Mazzola \/ Awakening \/ Getty Images Last Saturday, a larger-than-life, violin-shaped vessel wound its way down Venice\u2019s famed Grand Canal. The brainchild of Venetian artist Livio De Marchi, who is known for his fantastical giant sculptures, the 39-foot-long boat carried a string quartet that played Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s Four Seasons, among other compositions. As Elisabetta Povoledo reports for the New York Times, \u201cNoah\u2019s Violin,\u201d as the replica instrument is called, embarked on its journey alongside a handful of gondolas. Soon, a small fleet of motorboats, water taxis and traditional flat-bottomed vessels called sandoli joined the procession. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that between the wind and the waves, it was challenging,\u201d viola player Caterina Camozzi tells the Times. Cellist Tiziana Gasparoni adds that \u201cas a Venetian and a musician, it was the most moving experience of my life.\u201d Starting near Venice\u2019s city hall, the violin\u2019s journey concluded at the Customs House, across from Piazza San Marco. At the end of the one-hour voyage, a reverend blessed the boat and expressed his desire to see it \u201ctravel the world as a message of hope.\u201d According to NPR\u2019s Rachel Treisman, the violin was made from around 12 different kinds of wood. It features nuts, bolts and enough room for an inner motor. Local craftspeople constructed the boat on a nearby island, where it immediately attracted attention, notes Cailey Rizzo for Travel + Leisure. Companies and residents not affiliated with the endeavor asked how to get involved, and some even volunteered to help build the boat. De Marchi came up with the idea for the unusual vessel last year, during Covid-19 lockdown. He views the giant instrument as a symbol of Venice\u2019s rebirth, telling Venezia Todaythat \u201cas Noah put the animals on board the Ark to save them, we will spread art through music on this violin.\u201d The artist collaborated with the Venice Development Consortium to bring his vision to life. The team\u2019s choice of instrument, in addition to the waterside concert\u2019s emphasis on Vivaldi, clearly reference the city\u2019s \u201chistoric connection to music,\u201d writes Kyle Macdonald for Classic FM. Vivaldi, who is renowned as one of the Baroque period\u2019s greatest composers, was born in Venice in 1678 and wrote many of his famed works for the local Ospedale della Piet\u00e1\u2019s all-woman music ensemble. De Marchi, meanwhile, studied art and drawing at Venice\u2019s Accademia di Belle Arti. Per his website, the artist initially created sculptures in bronze and marble, but he decided to specialize in wood because \u201cit gives him a vitality which other materials do not.\u201d Beyond the violin, De Marchi has sculpted a giant shoe, a floating vintage car and an oversized origami hat. Now, reports the Times, businesses in Italy and a museum in China have expressed interest in acquiring his latest creation.

Sandy\/Chuck Harris at Flickr As the air cools and sunlight declines each fall, thousands of western monarch butterflies return to California to overwinter. One of the best places to watch the colorful spectacle is Pismo Beach. From now through February, more than 10,000 will take up residence in trees at Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove, one of five locations in the state to host so many of the colorful creatures. Just like tourists, the western monarchs prefer the sunny and warm conditions of the beachside state park. A western monarch butterfly gathers nectar from a plant. Stephanie McKnight of Xerces Society \u201cBy the thousands, the tiny little creatures bat their vibrant orange and black wings in unison as they find refuge from the cold for their long winter break,\u201d writes Stacey Leasca of Travel & Leisure magazine. \u201cAnd it turns out, they choose many of the same destinations we do for our winter vacations.\u201d The migration peaks in November, when the last of the western monarchs settle into the eucalyptus trees at Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove, located off scenic Highway 1 about halfway between San Jose and Los Angeles. Some have flown more than a thousand miles from as far away as Canada to escape winter\u2019s chilly temperatures. The butterflies cluster on tree limbs, where they mostly remain sedentary\u2014that is, until sunlight bathes the trees and the western monarchs begin to beat their wings. Activity reaches its peak in February, when their \u201cfancy lightly turns to thoughts of love,\u201d as the poet Tennyson once wrote about the amorous interactions of humans. \u201cAppropriately enough, mating season reaches its peak near Valentine\u2019s Day \u2015 an animated time at Monarch butterfly groves, indeed!\u201d states the California Highway 1 Discovery Route website. While this annual sight is spectacular, it pales in comparison to what used to be. Millions of western monarch butterflies\u2014a subspecies that resides west of the Rocky Mountains\u2014used to overwinter in California and Mexico only a few decades ago. Climate change, loss of habitat and pesticides are just a few of the environmental threats that have caused a more than 99 percent decline in populations since the 1980s, according to the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. \u201cIn monarchs\u2019 overwintering groves, there were once so many butterflies that the sound of their wings was described as a rippling stream or a summer rain,\u201d states the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cEarly newspaper descriptions described branches breaking under the weight of so many butterflies and depicted the masses of monarchs as \u2018the personification of happiness.\u2019\u201d Conservation efforts are underway in several states, including California, to help restore populations of monarch and western monarch butterflies. Environmental officials and volunteers are racing against time to save both species. It is unknown how successful these attempts will be. Scientists are concerned about the possibility of a complete collapse of the species since numbers have dropped so dramatically in the last few years. Sadly, the days of this annual display at Pismo Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove may be limited. David Kindy | | READ MORE David Kindy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

In these works, imposing ships wage war, navigate unfamiliar waters, or engage in acts of military and historic import, all while framed against the sea and the sky. As the ongoing exhibition \u201cIn American Waters\u201d demonstrates, these nautical paintings are just a drop in the ocean when it comes to the manifold ways in which American artists have rendered the sea in their work. Alternatively acting as a watery metaphor, a source of ever-changing beauty or the setting for epic journeys, the ocean has been an enduring muse for artists across generations. In other words, says Dan Finamore, a curator at the Peabody Essex Museum (PEM), in a statement, \u201cmarine painting is so much more than ship portraits.\u201d Finamore, who co-curated the exhibition with Austen Barron Bailly of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, adds, \u201cThrough more than 90 works, we can trace changing attitudes about the symbolic and emotional resonance of the sea in America and see how contemporary perspectives are informed by marine traditions.\u201d Fitz Henry Lane, Ship Southern Cross in Boston Harbor, 1851 Courtesy of Peabody Essex Museum \/ Photo by Mark Sexton \u201cIn American Waters\u201d is on view at the Salem, Massachusetts, museum through October 3. The show will then travel to Crystal Bridges, where it will welcome visitors from November 6 to the end of January 2022. Featured artists include Modernist George O\u2019Keeffe and contemporary portraitist Amy Sherald, who painted First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s official likeness. Other individuals included in the exhibition are Norman Rockwell, Jacob Lawrence, Kay WalkingStick, Hale Woodruff and Valerie Hegarty. All told, curator Sarah Chasse tells Jared Bowen of WGBH Boston, the show amounts to a \u201cwonderful exploration of American identity through the lens of the sea.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe, for her part, renders a gloomy beachfront scene almost abstract in Wave, Night (1928), using shades of dark blue and white to mark \u201cthe beach before her, the far distant horizon with a lighthouse, a wave rolling at her and the vacant space\u201d in between, as Finamore tells WGBH. In Sherald\u2019s Precious jewels by the sea (2019), the aquamarine ocean peeks out from behind a group of young, Black beachgoers: two girls seated on the shoulders of two boys, all holding the viewer\u2019s gaze. As Dinah Cardin writes for PEM\u2019s blog, Sherald creates \u201cimages of things that we normally do but we don\u2019t get to see in spaces like museums.\u201d Amy Sherald, Precious jewels by the sea, 2019 \u00a9 Amy Sherald \/ Image courtesy the artist and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art \/ Photo: Joseph Hyde These activities include such mundane events as \u201cBlack people going to the beach,\u201d adds Sherald. \u201cIt\u2019s really just about creating American narratives about American people\u2014while critiquing it at the same time.\u201d The artist\u2019s work also recalls the United States\u2019 long history of segregation laws, which restricted Black people from accessing beaches and other public gathering places. One seaside portrait in the show depicts George Washington, who sits in a chair framed by a calm ocean sunset and military vessels in the distance. Famed portraitist Gilbert Stuart painted the work in 1797 as a gift for Alexander Hamilton, who served as Secretary of the Treasury under the first president. Other featured selections, such as the panoramic oceanside scenes of one of the U.S.\u2019 first maritime painters, Michele Felice Corn\u00e8, helped define the genre for decades. Throughout the exhibition, notes Bailly in the statement, curators \u201c[analyze] the colonial and Eurocentric origins of American marine painting,\u201d which developed hand-in-hand with the rise of foreign commercial trade and European colonization of the Americas, the African continent and many other parts of the world. Bailly adds, \u201cWhen we think of marine painting we may think of high-seas realism and faithful portraits of ships but, as this exhibition attests, in practice we see broad-ranging expressions of American ambition, opportunity and invention.\u201d \u201cIn American Waters: The Sea in American Painting\u201d is on view at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, through October 3. The exhibition will travel to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, from November 6 to January 31, 2022.

Fittingly named the Museum of the American Arts and Crafts Movement (MAACM), the venue celebrates a creative philosophy that embraced fine artisanship and rejected the impersonal nature of industrialization. As Maggie Duffy reports for the Tampa Bay Times, the museum is the brainchild of Rudy Ciccarello, a local businessman, philanthropist and collector. In addition to the 800 or so items in its permanent collection, the cultural institution displays items from the Two Red Roses Foundation\u2014Ciccarello\u2019s private collection of Arts and Crafts objects. \u201cThis museum will be the epicenter for the study of the American Arts and Crafts movement,\u201d says Ciccarello in a statement. \u201cOur mission is to preserve and share these beautiful works of art with the public and to teach future generations to appreciate hand craftsmanship and honest design.\u201d Designed by Albert Alfonso of Tampa-based Alfonso Architects, the 5-story, 137,000-square-foot museum features a grand atrium, skylights and a spiral staircase. Along with gallery space, a theater and a reference library, the museum contains a restaurant, a theater, a cafe, an outdoor garden, an event space and a graphic studio. The design features period elements such as tiles, fountains, windows and lights. The museum showcases design elements like tiles and light fixtures. Joe Brennan \/ MAACM The building \u201cis inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement in its detailing and customization of material and joinery,\u201d says Alfonso in a statement quoted by the Art Newspaper\u2019s Wallace Ludel. \u201c[It] will serve the collection in its presentation of precious objects in a modern, functional and didactic way. The spaces will embrace natural light and respond to the different scales of the objects they hold.\u201d Ciccarello bought the land for the museum in 2014. It was originally slated to open in 2016, but the project hit delays along the way, and construction only began in 2017, reports Matt Hickman for the Architect\u2019s Newspaper. The opening was further delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, despite continuing high levels of Covid-19 transmission in Florida, most cultural institutions are open. MAACM, for its part, is implementing health and safety precautions as it welcomes its first visitors. The museum\u2019s collection (including loans from Two Red Roses) contains more than 2,000 objects, including furniture, pottery, woodblocks and leaded glass. About 800 works will be on display at any time, along with temporary exhibitions, notes the Art Newspaper. Two opening exhibitions are on display now through January 9, 2022. \u201cLove, Labor, and Art: The Roycroft Enterprise\u201d explores a craft school founded by writer and philosopher Elbert Hubbard in the 1890s in upstate New York. \u201cLenses Embracing the Beautiful: Pictorial Photographs From the Two Red Roses Foundation\u201d collects work made by amateur photographers between the 1890s and the 1940s. The museum stands five stories tall and features a grand atrium, theater and restaurant. Joe Brennan \/ MAACM The Arts and Crafts movement began in late Victorian England, where anxieties about increasing industrialization prompted a resurgence of interest in handcraftsmanship, wrote design historian and curator Monica Obniski for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008. The movement spread to the United States in the late 19th century, with artists in Boston forming the Society of Arts and Crafts in 1897. Chicago\u2019s Arts and Crafts Society began that same year at Hull House, the pioneering settlement house for immigrants founded by social reformers Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr. The decentralized movement also spawned societies in other cities, as well as social experiments such as the Rose Valley artistic community in Pennsylvania. According to Two Red Roses, the American iteration of the movement \u201cwas more a philosophy of living \u2026 than a distinct aesthetic style.\u201d Its principal tenets were \u201ca simple lifestyle, the use of quality, natural materials in handcraft, and an independent spirit in design and construction.\u201d Proponents of Arts and Crafts advocated for more widespread involvement in the design and creation of artistic objects. Many local societies organized workshops that encouraged young women to design and make pottery, jewelry and textiles. Publications such as House Beautiful and Ladies\u2019 Home Journal spread the movement\u2019s ideas about interior design broadly. MAACM will be open to guests Tuesdays through Sundays. Its website features a video introduction to the museum. Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian. She is also a freelance journalist based in New Hampshire.

Courtesy of Smoky Mountains Labor Day is almost here, and leaves in the Rocky Mountains are just beginning to change color. Parts of Oklahoma, meanwhile, won\u2019t hit their peak reds and oranges until November. To help travelers find the best times to check out breathtaking fall landscapes across the country, tourism site Smoky Mountains has released its ninth annual interactive fall foliage prediction map. The map provides granular, county-by-county and week-by-week predictions, showing when different parts of the country will approach peak autumnal glory, reports Brittany Anas for Forbes. It shows a few peak patches in places like Utah, Minnesota and Vermont during the week of September 20. Less than a month later, during the week of October 11, large swaths of the country, from Appalachia to western Washington State, should be at their best. \u201cSimilar to any meteorological forecast, leaf predictions will never be 100 percent accurate,\u201d says Smoky Mountains co-founder David Angotti in a statement quoted by Time Out\u2019s Emma Krupp. \u201cHowever, after publishing our predictive fall foliage map for nearly a decade, we are quite confident in our data sources, process and algorithm.\" As Cailey Rizzo reports for Travel + Leisure, Smoky Mountains plans to improve the 2021 map\u2019s accuracy by publishing an update in mid-September. \u201cOur experience combined with a scheduled mid-season update has us especially confident about this year\u2019s predictions,\u201d says Angotti in a statement to Travel + Leisure. \u201cOur goal is that this data-based, interactive tool will increase the number of people that are able to enjoy peak fall in 2021.\u201d Smoky Mountains uses publicly accessible data, including precipitation and temperature forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as average daylight exposure, to build its predictions, wrote Nora McGreevy for Smithsonian magazine last year. Fall foliage at Joshua\u2019s Crossing Covered Bridge in Lake Ann, Michigan Photo by Denis Buchner via Unsplash Per the United States Forest Service (USFS), the biggest factor in color change and falling leaves is length of day. Earlier sunsets and longer nights trigger biochemical processes within leaves, causing chlorophyll production to slow down and eventually stop. This removes green from the leaves, revealing colors produced by carotenoids, which create yellow, orange and brown tones. At the same time, veins that carry fluids in and out of leaves close off, trapping sugars and promoting the creation of anthocyanins, which produce red and purple colors. Weather also plays a role in foliage color. Spells of warm, sunny days and cool but not freezing nights are ideal for creating the most red-hued anthocyanin pigments. Since carotenoids are always present in leaves, yellow and gold tones are more consistent from year to year. Soil moisture can also affect foliage, with severe summer droughts making trees begin changing color later in the year. Jim Salge, a former meteorologist at the Mount Washington Observatory, tells the Washington Post\u2019s Natalie B. Compton that fall foliage may be hard to predict in some places this year. \u201cThe Pacific Northwest has had such an unbelievably abnormal year in terms of [its] climate,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to do to [its fall colors]. But places near normal climate conditions produce great foliage in many areas. \u2026 Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan all look great this year, and New England is always beautiful.\u201d Salge recently made his own predictions for the season in Yankee magazine\u2019s fall foliage forecast. He writes that central and southern New England\u2019s cool, wet summer seems to be causing earlier color changes in places that are typically wet, but the leaves should hold their color for a large part of the season. The Upper Midwest is also poised for a good fall for fans of colorful scenery\u2014but drought-stricken parts of the Southeast and Mountain West may have relatively short foliage seasons.

Photo by Luca Zanon \/ Awakening \/ Getty Images Venice has a mass tourism problem. Earlier this month, as some countries lifted Covid-19 restrictions and international travel slowly picked up steam, the Italian city welcomed up to 80,000 visitors each day, reports CNN Travel\u2019s Julia Buckley. According to local newspaper Il Gazzettino, tourists outnumbered Venice\u2019s 50,000 residents by more than 50 percent. To curb this onslaught of visitors, Italian officials have announced plans to charge entrance fees and require advance booking for would-be day-trippers, reports Laura Berlinghieri for La Stampa. Lawmakers approved the new measures this week. But plans to tax visitors to Venice have been in the works for years, notes Philip Willan for the London Times. Authorities delayed instituting an entry fee during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the city\u2019s trademark canals, elegant footbridges and towering St. Mark\u2019s Basilica briefly stood empty. Beginning next summer, however, day visitors will need to book tickets in advance and pay a fee of \u20ac3 to \u20ac10 (about $3.50 to $11.80). Costs will vary depending on the season and the anticipated number of tourists on any given day. As Alessandro Speciale reports for Bloomberg, the extra cost will not apply to people who book stays in local hotels, children under 6 years old, or city residents and their relatives. Ticketed visitors will need to enter Venice\u2019s historic sector through turnstiles\u2014a move that has drawn criticism from some locals. \u201cThis is the consecration of Venice as a theme park with access subject to the payment of a ticket,\u201d city council member and lawyer Marco Gasparinetti tells La Stampa, per a translation by Forbes\u2019 Laurie Werner. \u201cIt is humiliating for the city, for its residents and for visitors.\u201d View of Venice's Rialto Bridge Shaun Dunmall via Flickr under CC BY-2.0 In an op-ed for the Telegraph, Buckley points out that overnight visitors to Venice already pay a tax of up to \u20ac5 a night (around $5.90). These longer-term tourists tend to contribute more to the local economy than day-trippers, who often bring their own food and drink and take pictures outside rather than purchasing entry to the city\u2019s museums, churches and other attractions. Large crowds attracted by cheap flights and the 1,600-year-old city\u2019s famed canals and architecture have wreaked havoc on Venice by polluting and overcrowding central areas. Last week, CNN Travel reported that Venice\u2019s public transit system has resorted to hiring security guards to control unruly crowds. Though employees are not required to carry their weapons, many licensed guards opt to do so. Constant throngs of tourists make the seaside city a difficult place to live. Venice\u2019s historic center has lost half of its population in the past four decades, eroding the city\u2019s social fabric and its local economy, as Anna Momigliano reported for the New York Times in July. Cruise ships have presented a separate, but related problem, for Venetian locals, as they allow tourists to descend on the city\u2019s historic sites en masse for short periods of time. (Day-trippers, including cruise ship passengers, constitute 73 percent of visitors to Venice but just 18 percent of the tourism economy, per the Times.) Unesco has long warned that ships of this size pose an environmental threat to the city\u2019s fragile lagoon ecosystem. In late July, Italy took a major step by banning large cruise ships from Venice\u2019s waters, as Gaia Pianigiani and Emma Bubola reported separately for the New York Times. The ban, which took effect on August 1, impacts ships weighing more than 25,000 tons or measuring longer than about 590 feet. \u201cThe intervention could no longer be delayed,\u201d said Italy\u2019s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, in a statement quoted by the New York Times.

East Suffolk Council Two of Banksy\u2019s newest murals were vandalized just days after the elusive street artist officially confirmed that he\u2019d created them. The artworks numbered among ten discovered across several coastal towns in Norfolk and Suffolk, England, earlier this month, reports BBC News. The series, dubbed \u201cA Great British Spraycation,\u201d features such scenes as a group of hermit crabs, a couple dancing atop of a bus shelter and a seagull attempting to steal food. Photos shared on social media over the weekend showed white paint covering what was originally an image of a rat sipping from a cocktail while lounging in a chair. Per a statement from East Suffolk Council, security guards in the town of Lowestoft caught the perpetrator mid-act and managed to prevent further damage from occurring. \u201cWe are naturally appalled someone has chosen to behave in such a selfish and mindless way, given how excited we are all by the appearance of these works here on the east coast,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe are, however, hopeful that this particular work can be restored, and are engaging with specialists.\u201d Local residents expressed outrage over the vandalism. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing piece of work and it\u2019s been ruined. People obviously have nothing better to do,\u201d 24-year-old Faye Louise Stone tells BBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that Banksy comes and does artwork in our town. We should embrace it, not destroy it.\u201d One of the Banksy pieces on the Lowestoft seafront has been defaced.Volunteers are carefully trying repair the work. pic.twitter.com\/titDHfFtXp\u2014 Ben Parker (@BP_BBC) August 15, 2021 East Suffolk Council had hoped that the piece, along with four nearby murals from the series, would bolster its bid to become the next U.K. City of Culture, reports Holly Hume for SuffolkLive. Winning the nationwide competition, which is held every four years, would bring a major boost to the local tourism industry. \u201cIf [Banksy] wanted to endorse that bid, then putting some street art up in the town is the ideal way of doing so,\u201d councilor Edward Back tells SuffolkLive. Speaking with BBC News, Paul Gough, principal and vice chancellor of Arts University Bournemouth, says that rats have been the artist's \u201crodent of choice for decades: irreverent, playful characters that have [also] popped up during his Covid-inspired period.\u201d The day before news of the Lowestoft defacement broke, vandals targeted another Banksy mural of a machine game claw in Gorleston, Norfolk. Additional graffiti of teddy bears positioned beneath the claw is thought to be the work of local artist Emo, added as a potential tribute or collaboration between the two artists. Resident Jayne Kimbling posted a photograph of the damage on Facebook Friday. Red spray paint covers Emo\u2019s signature, with the word \u201cEgo\u201d written out instead\u2014perhaps as a criticism of the partnership, per Casey Cooper-Fiske of the Eastern Daily Press. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) Great Yarmouth Borough Council has since ordered the protection of the defaced machine game claw, installing a clear panel over the work, reports Jasper King for the Eastern Daily Press. Per East Suffolk Council, protective measures for the Banksy pieces in Lowestoft and Oulton Broad have been initiated and will be implemented soon. Some locals think these safeguarding steps are unnecessary. \u201cThe beauty of Banksy is that his work is created out in vulnerable locations,\u201d resident Richard Girling tells King of the Eastern Daily Press. \u201cThey are wonderfully exposed and that is the beauty of it. Where else would you ever see an artwork worth millions of millions of pounds on a sea wall?\u201d In addition to the two vandalized pieces, two installments in the series have been removed. One, located in Gorleston, showed two children flying off an inflatable dinghy. Great Yarmouth Borough Council covered the mural up, citing the 2018 death of a 3-year-old girl who suffered fatal injuries after an inflatable trampoline she was on burst at a nearby beach, per BBC News. The council\u2019s official statement thanked Banksy for the work and stated that members were \u201cconfident\u201d the work could be restored at a \u201cmore suitable, alternative location.\u201d The other artwork, located in King\u2019s Lynn, was first spotted August 4. Banksy added a pink tongue and an ice cream cone to a statue of Frederick Savage, who served as the Norfolk town\u2019s mayor between 1889 and 1890. Council workers took down the playful add-ons to the monument, which was unveiled in 1892, following complaints by locals, writes Rebekah Chilvers for Lynn News.

National Gallery London\u2019s National Gallery boasts an impressive array of art. Founded in 1824, the museum is home to more than 2,300 paintings spanning the 13th through 20th centuries. Highlights of the collection include the most comprehensive assortment of Italian Renaissance paintings outside of Italy and works by such luminaries as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Vermeer. This summer, visitors to London can appreciate the gallery\u2019s art without actually going inside. Now through September 2, a pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square invites art lovers to view more than 20 life-size reproductions of some of the most recognizable works in the museum\u2019s collection, from Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Venus and Mars (1485) to Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers (1888). \u201cThe idea came from the experience of Covid, the pandemic and confinement,\u201d curator Christine Riding tells Euronews\u2019 Debora Gandini, per Google Translate. \u201cHence the need to exhibit outdoor collections that were [previously] found inside.\u201d As BBC News reports, the installation is part of the Westminster Council\u2019s Inside Out festival, a new showcase featuring outdoor art, entertainment and cultural events. Running through October 31, the festival seeks to draw tourists back to London\u2019s West End. Titian, Bacchus and Ariadne, 1522-23 Public domain via Wikimedia Commons \u201cBy bringing a series of life-size replicas onto the North Terrace of Trafalgar Square, all visitors to the area can enjoy a taste of the treasures we have inside the National Gallery,\u201d says the gallery\u2019s director, Gabriele Finaldi, in a statement. \u201cFor curious minds wanting to know more, the paintings can be scanned and a new world of discovery will be delivered to your phone.\u201d Visitors can use the free Smartify app to scan QR codes and learn more about the works on display, writes Felicity Carter for Forbes. The show is also included in Art of London\u2019s augmented reality art trail. The reproductions on view range in size from about 3 to 6.5 feet wide, making them readily visible from a distance, according to the statement. The largest work in the open-air gallery is a replica of Titian\u2019s Bacchus and Ariadne (1520-23), which renders the Roman myth in the artist\u2019s characteristically rich hues. Per the statement, the Inside Out festival also includes events like Sketch on the Square, a series of free, daily art activities focused on mindfulness and wellbeing, and \u201cPiccadilly Art Takeover,\u201d a public art exhibition hosted by the Royal Academy of Arts and Art of London. Joseph Mallord William Turner, The Fighting Temeraire, 1839 Public domain via Wikimedia Commons Among the highlights of the National Gallery\u2019s pop-up display is a reproduction of Joseph Mallord William Turner\u2019s The Fighting Temeraire (1839), which depicts a hazy warship sailing into harbor at daybreak. The gold, blue and gray painting is one of Turner\u2019s most well-preserved works, likely because the artist relied on traditional oil painting techniques rather than the experimental methods he usually used, notes the gallery on its website. \u201cWhen [Turner] died in 1851 he bequeathed it and the rest of the paintings he owned to the nation,\u201d wrote scholar Abram Fox for Smarthistory in 2015. \u201cIt quickly became seen as an image of Britain\u2019s relationship to industrialization. Steam power has proved itself to be much stronger and more efficient than old technology, but that efficiency came with the cost of centuries of proud tradition.\u201d Also on display is a copy of van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers, which depicts a vase filled with lurid blossoms painted in yellow ocher and Veronese green. According to the Van Gogh Museum, the flowers represented gratitude to the famed Impressionist artist, who created a total of five large canvases featuring the eponymous flowers. Other reproductions in the show\u2014aptly marketed as a display of the \u201cnation\u2019s favorite paintings\u201d\u2014include John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain (1821), Jan van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait (1434) and Hans Holbein the Younger\u2019s Portrait of Christina of Denmark (1538).

Now, a peer-reviewed study using satellite imagery and a review by an international organization are warning that warming temperatures in the far northern reaches of Russia are releasing massive measures of methane\u2014a potent greenhouse gas with considerably more warming power than carbon dioxide. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news if it\u2019s right,\u201d Robert Max Holmes, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who was not involved in either report, tells Steve Mufson of the Washington Post. \u201cNobody wants to see more potentially nasty feedbacks and this is potentially one.\u201d Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, the study of satellite photos of a previously unexplored site in Siberia detected large amounts of methane being released from exposed limestone. A heat wave in 2020 was responsible for the emissions along two large strips of rock formations in the Yenisey-Khatanga Basin, located several hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle. Lead author Nikolaus Froitzheim, a geoscientist at the University of Bonn in Germany, is concerned about his study\u2019s findings. Interpreting this data correctly \u201cmay make the difference between catastrophe and apocalypse\u201d as the climate crisis worsens, he tells Tara Yarlagadda of Inverse. In 2020, temperatures in the basin rose nearly 11 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, causing the limestone to release ancient methane deposits that had been trapped inside. The data caught Fritzheim and other researchers by surprise, who anticipated finding gas in other locations. \u201cWe would have expected elevated methane in areas with wetlands,\u201d he tells the Washington Post. \u201cBut these were not over wetlands but on limestone outcrops. There is very little soil in these. It was really a surprising signal from hard rock, not wetlands.\u201d Another report echoes these anxieties. Published by the Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG), it calls for a \u201cglobal state of emergency\u201d as temperatures continue to climb in Siberia and other Arctic regions. Permafrost covers 65 percent of Russian lands, but it\u2019s melting fast. \u201cScientists have been shocked that the warm weather conducive to permafrost thawing is occurring roughly 70 years ahead of model projections,\u201d the CCAG warning states. It also points out that the Arctic could lose 89 percent of its permafrost by 2100, the Moscow Times reports. The CCAG report cautions that warming temperatures could be pushing the Arctic toward an \u201cirreversible\u201d tipping point, causing the release of methane and other gases, as well as crumbling infrastructure in Siberia, including dams and a nuclear power plant. \u201cThe story is simple,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cClimate change is happening faster than anticipated. One consequence\u2014the loss of ice in the polar regions\u2014is also a driver for more rapid global heating and disastrously rapid global sea level rise.\u201d David Kindy | | READ MORE David Kindy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Benson Kua via Flickr under Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0) A post-Covid-19 economic inflationary surge has seafood places rewriting their menus\u2014sans lobsters, scallops, crab and many fish dishes. Prices have risen by as much as 50 percent in the last quarter due to a lack of fishers and truck drivers combined with climbing consumer demand, reports Christine Blank of SeafoodSource.com. \u201cThe price we had to charge to be profitable was almost insulting,\u201d Josue Pena, chef at The Iberian Pig in Atlanta, tells SeafoodSource.com. He was forced to remove the restaurant\u2019s signature crab coquettes after crab prices nearly doubled. Overall, the wholesale price of finfish and shellfish rose 18.8 percent from June 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, reports Will Feuer of the New York Post. Halibut soared from $16 a pound to $28, while blue crab skyrocketed from $18 to $44\u2014an increase of more than 140 percent. Per Bloomberg\u2019s Adam Jackson and Kate Krader, the jump in seafood prices is part of broader inflationary increase working its way through the economy as the United States continues to emerge from the pandemic. However, the seafood surge is also related to an employment shortage, port congestion, lack of product, rising prices and transportation issues. \u201cDistributors used to hustle and bustle to get your business,\u201d Jay Herrington of Fish On Fire in Orlando tells Bloomberg. \"You don\u2019t get a delivery, or it\u2019s a late delivery. Sometimes we have to go and pick it up.\u201d The root cause is a lack of workers in the fishing industry. Many left the industry at the peak of the pandemic when demand was low\u2014and they don\u2019t appear to be returning to work anytime soon. \u201cA lot of people went into construction,\u201d Michael Priebel, manager of Keys Fisheries in Marathon, Florida, tells Bloomberg. \u201cWe see less and less people coming back every year because they are getting old and fishing is getting more expensive.\u201d Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, restaurant owners have endured the brunt of economic pressures. In addition to capacity restrictions and diminished demand, those businesses have been hit by major increases in supply costs and worker wages. So far, Brennan Heretick, co-owner of High Tide Harry\u2019s in Orlando, has resisted passing on those costs to customers, many of whom are just returning to his restaurant. The result? He experienced record revenues with a $14,000 loss in recent months. \u201cWe hope that when we do have to have a little bit of a price increase, that everybody\u2019s understanding that we did everything we could,\u201d Heretick tells Bloomberg.

Despite their iconic status, no museum dedicated to these mythical, sea-dwelling creatures existed on the East Coast of the United States\u2014until now. As Matthew Prensky reports for the Salisbury Daily Times, the aptly titled Mermaid Museum opened in Berlin, a small town in southern Maryland, this March. The space aims to highlight the history of mermaids by displaying artifacts and artworks associated with the fictional finned beings. \u201cEven though we know so much more about the sea, we are still compelled by the myth of the mermaid,\u201d says poet Nancy Mitchell, who worked on the museum with founder Alyssa Maloof, to Deana Harley of WMDT. \u201c\u2026 She was a creature that wedded two worlds, and she was also a creature of the sea, and she was beyond all the rules of society, \u2026 beyond the rules of man.\u201d Fittingly, notes Baylor Spears for Washingtonian, the 2,200-square-foot venue is located about ten miles inland from Ocean City.

To prepare for the opening, Maloof spoke with Vaughn Scribner, author of Merpeople: A Human History, and read Sea Enchantress, a 1961 tome that describes marine folklore.

Alyssa Maloof Photography \/ Mermaid Museum Stories about mermaids date back thousands of years and span cultures across the globe, from Western Europe to Southeast Asia, notes Royal Museums Greenwich. In some societies, mermaids symbolize vitality and fertility, while in others, they represent the chaotic nature of the ocean. Slavic mythology, for instance, references water nymphs called rusalki who were originally viewed as benevolent spirits of abundance and agriculture. In the 1800s, however, these nymphs gained a reputation as vengeful creatures who beckoned sailors and children to their deaths. A more positive portrayal of a half-fish, half-human being is Suvannamaccha, a princess who helps a hero build a bridge across the sea in the epic Indian poem the Ramayana. Maloof\u2019s museum isn\u2019t the only mermaid-centric attraction to debut in recent months: In April, the International Mermaid Museum opened in western Washington state.

Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, eleventh Duke of Devonshire For decades, an unsettling portrait of Yale University\u2019s namesake and early benefactor, British American colonist Elihu Yale, carried a maddeningly incomplete description. The painting shows four white men in costly 18th-century outfits posing around a table, with Yale at the center. As the men smoke and sip madeira, Yale\u2019s grandchildren play in the field behind them. In the right corner of the canvas, a child of African descent pours wine for the group. He wears fine red and grey clothes and\u2014most disturbingly\u2014a silver collar locked around his neck. First donated to the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) in 1970 and exhibited sporadically over the past five decades, the painting was initially displayed with wall text that listed the men\u2019s titles but did not mention the enslaved child at their side. When the gallery was rehung in 2016, a new line acknowledged little beyond the boy\u2019s apparel: \u201cNothing is known ... except that his livery identifies him as a servant, and the padlocked collar indicates that he is enslaved.\u201d A boy of African descent, estimated to be about 10 years old, serves madeira to the wealthy white men at the table. Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire Unanswered questions about the enslaved child haunted New Haven resident Titus Kaphar when he first saw the portrait in 2016. Inspired, the artist painted Enough About You, which warps the 18th-century work beyond recognition, save for the boy\u2019s portrait, which is framed in gold. Kaphar\u2019s subject stares directly at the viewer and does not wear a collar. As the artist told Terence Trouillot of Artnet Newsin 2019, \u201cI decided to physically take action to quiet [and crumple] the side of the painting that we\u2019ve been talking about for a very long time and turn up the volume on this kid\u2019s story.\u201d Four years after Kaphar created Enough About You, the YCBA embarked on a project to do just that. Last fall, after a landmark summer of protests against racial injustice, director Courtney J. Martin decided to temporarily remove the Yale group portrait from view. The museum hung Kaphar\u2019s painting, on an eight-month loan from private collectors in California, in its place. Meanwhile, a group of five YCBA employees volunteered to research the enslaved child and his portrait in new depth. Software engineer Eric James, senior curatorial assistant Abigail Lamphier, senior library assistant Lori Misura, coordinator of cataloging David K. Thompson and assistant curator Edward Town published their initial findings online earlier this year. Viewers can explore the report via the YCBA website and the related Yale and Slavery Research Project website. As of this week, members of the public can once again view the reinstalled Yale portrait, bolstered by rewritten wall texts that add newfound historical context to the image, as Nancy Kenney reports for the Art Newspaper. \u201cHow long will it stay [up]? That\u2019s the answer I don\u2019t have just yet,\u201d Martin tells the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe conversation is evolving.\u201d Titus Kaphar, Enough About You, 2016 Photo by Richard Caspole \/ Collection of Arthur Lewis and Hau Nguyen \/ Courtesy of the artist The painting\u2019s new label holds several revelations from the researchers. Whereas previous estimates had dated the portrait to 1708, chemical analysis conducted in the past year now suggests that it was completed around 1719. The experts also ascribed the formerly unattributed work to John Verelst, a Dutch portraitist working in Britain during that period, and retitled it Elihu Yale With Members of His Family and an Enslaved Child. Though the team has yet to uncover the identity of the Black child, Town tells Smithsonian that he still has hope. Scholars sometimes argue that European artists did not paint people of African or Indian descent from real-life models but instead invented from fabricated stereotypes\u2014an assumption that strikes Town as \u201cunsatisfying and wrong.\u201d \u201cThe full story hasn\u2019t yet been told,\u201d he says. Recovering the child\u2019s biography \u201cmight prove impossible, but it is still the goal here.\u201d Despite lacking a name for the child, the YCBA team has managed to flesh out some details of his life and status. Based on input from pediatricians, the team estimates that he was about 10 years old. He would have been one of many people, mostly boys under the age of 10, taken from their families in British colonies in Africa and India and forced to work as enslaved \u201cpages\u201d in the households of wealthy white men. (This work in particular was probably painted at Yale\u2019s house in London.) The child\u2019s enslavers also forced him to wear a padlocked collar. As the Art Newspaper reports, this was a common practice: YCBA researchers have identified at least 50 other paintings made in Britain between 1660 and 1760 that depict enslaved individuals wearing similar collars, sometimes engraved with an enslaver\u2019s name or other identifying marks. \u201cThis collar is not used to tether someone to another set of chains, in the way that a similar-looking object would be in Jamaica or Barbados at the same time,\u201d says Town. Rather, \u201c[o]ne of the invidious, cruelest things about it is that these collars would have been highly finished, high-status objects.\u201d As instruments of control, the bands symbolically marked their wearers as enslaved and prevented them from easily running away. Town is careful to qualify that the precise details of this child\u2019s bondage would have differed from the experiences of enslaved people in the British colonies, where slavery was codified by law. Chattel slavery technically had \u201cno legal basis\u201d in England, per Historic U.K. But many Black people were forced to work in British households in \u201can ill-defined but often violently enforced state of what historians have characterized as \u2018slavish servitude,\u2019\u201d the researchers write. (The slippery legal semantics around enslavement within Britain\u2019s shoreline would later be tested in court, most notably in the 1772 case of James Somerset, adds Town.) The child\u2019s precise relationship with the four men in the painting is likewise unclear. Some clues have come to light: for instance, the man standing at Yale\u2019s shoulder is newly identified as David Yale, the patriarch\u2019s adopted heir. He looms over Lord James Cavendish, to the left of Yale, and a figure now identified as Yale\u2019s son-in-law William Cavendish, on the right. In other words, this is a family portrait that Yale likely commissioned near the end of his life to promote his power and legacy, says Town. Born in 1649 in Boston, the merchant made his fortune during a 20-year tenure working for (and stealing from) the East India Company in present-day Chennai (then called Madras). He later retired in luxury to Wales and England. In 1718, he donated a set of expensive goods to the future Yale University, lending the young Connecticut college its name. Town and historian Teanu Reid note that the extent of Yale\u2019s direct involvement in the trade of enslaved people remains unclear. But other scholars argue that he certainly would have benefited and profited from the trade indirectly, as Mark Alden Branch reported for Yale Alumni magazine last year. No known written records prove that Yale personally enslaved people. His private papers are missing\u2014a fact that further complicates efforts to determine how the young boy ended up painted into a group portrait. This lack of a paper trail means that researchers can\u2019t say for certain whether Yale or one of his relatives claimed ownership of the child. That being said, \u201c[f]or me, it\u2019s splitting hairs, because they\u2019re all one social and economic and familial unit,\u201d says Town. James Worsdale painted this work, Elihu Yale With His Servant, sometime in the 18th century. The painting was removed from public display in 2007. Public domain via Yale University Art Gallery Research into the boy\u2019s identity and story is ongoing. Archivists are currently investigating regional archives located near the estates of Yale and his sons-in-law, who owned properties in Suffolk, Buckinghamshire and Derbyshire, for clues about their lives, businesses and households, per the Art Newspaper. While Yale\u2019s relationship to the institution of slavery is subject to historical debate, he was certainly comfortable sitting for portraits that featured enslaved people. Of the seven painted likenesses of Yale in the university\u2019s holdings, three depict him alongside an enslaved person: the aforementioned family portrait attributed to Verelst, a rendition of the same group on copper and a separate full-length portrait that once hung in the university\u2019s Corporation Room. The last of these, which was removed from public view in 2007 due to its racist themes, shows an enslaved adult of Indian or South Asian heritage walking up to Yale and holding out a letter. The artist, James Worsdale, attempts to marginalize the figure of the servant, depicting him as emerging from the shadows and rendering him as slight compared to Yale\u2019s imposing bulk. Similarly, Verelst painted the young African boy in the corner of his group composition. In a 2014 YCBA exhibition, curators asked attendees to disobey these visual cues and instead consider the enslaved child in the portrait as if he were the focus of the work. As Kaphar demonstrated with Enough About You, artists can encourage members of the public to \u201creframe\u201d portraits like Elihu Yale, literally and figuratively. \u201cI wanted to find a way to imagine a life for this young man that the historical painting had never made space for in the composition: his desires, dreams, family, thoughts, hopes,\u201d Kaphar told Artnet News in 2019. \u201cThose things were never subjects that the original artist wanted the viewer to contemplate.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

They are also asking residents near Golden to check for video, such as dash cam footage, from October 3 at 11:33 p.m. that may have captured a glimpse of the fireball. (Pictured: A shooting star streaks across a starry sky in British Columbia; image is not associated with the incident.) Preserved Light Photography via Getty Images When Ruth Hamilton awoke on October 3 to the sound of her dog barking, followed shortly by an explosion and drywall debris falling on her face, she was afraid there was an intruder in the house, she tells Claire Palmer at the Pipestone Flyer. She was on the telephone with an emergency operator when she noticed a dark gray rock behind her pillows that matched the fist-sized hole in her ceiling. The police officer who visited Hamilton\u2019s home in Golden, British Columbia, first suspected a nearby construction site might have been to blame for the projectile. But there was no blasting at the site that night. Instead, the construction workers tipped the officer off to another explanation. They heard booming and saw an explosion in the sky just before Hamilton reported the impact. \u201cThe police officer came back in and said: \u2018Well, I think you have meteorite in your bed,\u2019\" says Hamilton to CTV News Vancouver\u2019s David Molko. The meteorite weighs about 2.8 pounds and is the size of a large adult fist, per John Yoon and Vjosa Isai at the New York Times. Hamilton shared the meteorite with researchers at the University of Western Ontario, which has a collection of meteorites, so they can study the extraterrestrial intruder. \"It's certainly a meteorite,\" says University of Western Ontario meteor physicist Peter Brown to CBC News. \"Everything about the story was consistent with a meteorite fall, and the fact that this bright fireball had occurred basically right at the same time made it a pretty overwhelming case.\" The researchers plan to to gather images, measurements and possibly samples of the meteorite, per CTV News. They are also asking residents near Golden to check for video, such as dash cam footage, from October 3 at 11:33 p.m. that may have captured a glimpse of the fireball. Researchers can use video to reconstruct the path that the meteorite followed from the asteroid belt to Earth, says Brown to the Vancouver Sun. On average, fewer than ten meteorites are recovered each year; most meteors burn up in the atmosphere, and many land in the wilderness or the ocean. But just last year, a meteorite crash-landed in an Indonesian home, Andreas Illmer reported for BBC News at the time. Only one person, Ann Hodges, has ever survived a meteorite strike. Like Hamilton, Hodges was at home when the meteorite burst through the ceiling. The nine-pound meteorite bounced off a radio and hit Hodges\u2019 thigh, leaving a deep bruise. Hamilton considers herself lucky to have escaped the encounter without injury. \u201cI never got hurt,\u201d she tells the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through this experience, and I never even got a scratch. So all I had to do is have a shower and wash the drywall dust away.\u201d By the end of November, the meteorite will return to Hamilton\u2019s care. Because it landed on her property, the meteorite belongs to Hamilton, and she plans to keep it. It is not only a souvenir of the unusual night, she tells the Pipestone Flyer.

Every fall, some of the largest brown bears in the world gorge themselves on sockeye salmon at Brooks River in Katmai National Park, Alaska. To the delight of internet onlookers, the slender bears prepare for hibernation by ballooning into fluffy brown blimps. \u201cFat Bear Week is really a celebration of success and survival,\u201d says Lian Law, a visual information specialist at Katmai, to Natalie B. Compton for the Washington Post. \u201cWe really highlight the resilience and adaptability of bears here.\u201d Each day of Fat Bear Week, which spans from September 29 to October 5, the public is asked to choose between the \u201cfattest of the fat\u201d in online daily mashups. Voters can judge the bears on any combination of criteria\u2014floofiness, chonkiness, or inexplicable charm. Enthusiasts can also download their own March Madness\u2013style bracket and watch the bears feast via a live river cam. The bear with the most votes each day advances until one girthy goober is crowned the champion on \"Fat Bear Tuesday,\" which falls on October 5 this year. The first iteration of the competition took place in 2014 as a single-day event and has since soared in popularity. In 2019, more than 200,000 votes were cast. Last year, the number grew to more than 600,000 votes. The official Fat Bear Week 2021 Bracket Katmai National Park and Preserve via Flickr The annual tournament celebrates the bears\u2019 success in preparation for their long winter hibernation, but it\u2019s also become part of a conservation movement. Though the bears are reaching peak fatness this week, Fat Bear Week is an entire summer of eating in the making. The bears eat around 90 pounds of fish, berries, small mammals, and vegetation each day to pack on the pounds necessary to survive months of winter hibernation. They\u2019ll lose over a third of their body fat during their winter snooze, which lasts about six months. If the brown bears don\u2019t have access to calorie-rich foods like salmon, they may not survive the winter. \u201cIt really does raise awareness about their ecosystem,\u201d Law says to the Washington Post. \u201cWe are holding these Brooks bears and the Brooks area as an exemplary illustration of a healthy ecosystem...So, yes, we are celebrating the success of these bears, but it\u2019s important also not to forget that not all the bears and all of those places are so fortunate.\u201d This years\u2019 late salmon run hasn\u2019t deterred hordes of bears from seeking salmon in the Brooks River, according to a National Parks Service press release. The lumbering creatures appear to have had no problem plumping up. \"They are pretty massive,\" says Naomi Boak, the media ranger at Katmai National Park and Preserve, to Mashable\u2019s Mark Kaufman.

National Parks Service and Explore.org As last year\u2019s champion, some expect 747 to clinch a back-to-back victory. In September 2020, scientists estimated he weighed more than 1,400 pounds and he appears even bigger this year. According to Explore.org, 747 yielded to the river\u2019s most dominant bear, 856, for many years until this summer 2021. \u201cHe's the fattest and largest bear I've ever seen,\" said Mike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger and currently a resident naturalist for explore.org, to Mashable last year. \"I feel a special bit of privilege to witness a bear as big as he.\" In July, 747 trumped his long-time rival to become the river\u2019s top bear. 747 rarely has to get aggressive with others\u2014most bears recognize they\u2019re no match for his sheer size and stay out of his way. 128 \u201cGrazer\u201d Grazer is one of the river\u2019s many bold female bears. National Parks Service and Explore.org Bear 128, called \"Grazer,\" is often one of the fattest bears to visit the Brooks River and this year, she returned with two young cubs. She\u2019s known as a defensive mama bear, often picking fights with much larger bears, including dominant adult males, to keep her cubs safe. Grazer\u2019s boldness is risky but pays off with access to the best fishing spots in the river. 435 \u201cHolly\u201d The experienced mama bear earned the 2019 title for her girthy glow-up. National Parks Service and Explore.org Holly might start the season looking a little scraggly, but by early fall, this sturdy gal resembles \u201cthe shape and color of a toasted marshmallow,\u201d according to Explore.org. The 2019 Fat Bear Week champion is the super-mom of the river. In 2014, Holly adopted an abandoned cub and raised it alongside her biological cub. Both of the cubs are now successful adults, 503 and 719. When Holly earned her heavyweight title in 2019, \"it was very hard to get a good picture [of Holly] out of the water,\" Boak to NPR\u2019s Tom Goldman, \"because she was a submarine for the entire month.

Testing showed their worst fears were true: presumptive positive results for the virus that causes Covid-19. Final results of testing are expected in the next few days. Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers are now being treated for the virus. The sick cats are receiving antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication. In addition to respiratory distress, the animals are also showing signs of lethargy and reduced weight from decreased appetites, according to National Zoo statement. Zoo officials say the public is not at risk of contracting Covid-19 from the big cats \u201cgiven the substantial distance between the animals and visitors,\u201d reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post.

David Paul Morris\/Getty Images Since launching the first Happy Meal in 1979, McDonald's has churned out iconic Happy Meal toys year after year\u2014from McFurbys to dozens of Disney characters. Now, the McDonald's Happy Meal is about to undergo a more sustainable update. Last month, McDonald's announced that by the end of 2025, every Happy Meal toy sold around the world would be more eco-friendly and consist of renewable and recycled materials. The change from traditional plastic toys should result in a 90 percent reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use, according to a statement. This amount is comparable to 650,000 people not using plastic for a year, Bill Chappell reports for NPR. \"With this transition for our toys, we're working closely with suppliers, families, and play experts and engineers to introduce more sustainable, innovative designs and help drive demand for recycled materials, to keep McDonald's communities and beyond smiling for generations to come,\" Jenny McColloch, the Chief Sustainability Officer for McDonald's, said in a statement. New sustainable toys will feature buildable 3-D paper figures and other toys made from plant-derived materials or recycled plastic, reports Insider's Cheryl Teh. The change to more eco-friendly toys is already underway in some countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. In France, kids can choose between receiving a sustainable toy or a book in the \"One Book or One Toy\" program with their Happy Meal, report Deema Zein and Julia Griffin for PBS News Hour. However, some experts say that while reducing the number of plastic toys is the first step, the fast-food giant is only scratching the surface. \"Given that McDonald's is one of the world's largest franchising brands, more can be done in terms of other operations, like reducing their carbon footprint while moving products across supply chains,\" Sharon Seah, a climate change expert at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told Insider. Seah explained to Insider that McDonald's could offer more vegan or plant-based options on their menu to reduce beef consumption. Other fast-food chains, like Burger King and Qdoba, already offer plant-based meat options like the Impossible Whopper and other Impossible-brand meat options for burritos and tacos, Erica Chayes Wida reports for Today. McDonald's sells more than a billion pounds of beef in the United States alone, per Insider. In 2018, cattle, sheep, and goat farming produced 178 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, per the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems. Aside from switching out plastic toys for cardboard ones, McDonald's aims to reduce their packaging waste. By 2025, McDonald's plans to obtain 100 percent of its guest packaging from recycled sources and recycle the packaging in all its restaurants, NPR reports. Currently, the company has reached 80 percent of this goal. \"By reducing conventional virgin plastic inputs by a projected 90 percent, the re-imagined toys will reduce the demand on fossil fuel plastic production to instead create new markets for responsibly-sourced renewable and recycled content,\" said Sheila Bonini, the Senior Vice President at World Wildlife Fund, in a McDonald's statement. \"And through its immense reach of these toys, McDonald's can engage its millions of daily customers around the world in the transition to a more sustainable, circular future.\" Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

(Pictured: A zebra stands in a field of yellow flowers in Namibia.) Westend61 via Getty Images Editor's Note, October 15, 2021: Prince George County officials publicly announced one of the rogue zebras was found dead at a private residence on September 16 after getting caught in a small animal snare, the Washington Post reports. Initially, officials had reported five zebras missing, when in fact only three had escaped. Now, only two remain at large. The zebras first escaped on August 30 from an 80-acre farm off Duley Station Road in Upper Marlboro. Imagine looking out into your backyard and seeing zebras: It sounds like something out of a dream or a trippy song from the 1970s. But for the past month, it\u2019s been reality for residents of suburban Maryland. It all started on August 31, when five of the striped mammals escaped from a private farm in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, reports Michael Levenson of the New York Times. \u201cWhen I first heard about it I was like, \u2018OK, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me, right? Zebras?\u2019\u201d Rodney Taylor, chief of the Prince George\u2019s County Animal Services Division, told Levenson. In four decades of catching runaway animals, this would be his first experience going after the equine species. As it turns out, catching zebras is a pretty tricky endeavor. Having evolved to escape predators such as lions on the flat savannah and grasslands of Africa, zebras can run very fast at a moment\u2019s notice. Because of the animal's instinct to flee, animal control officials avoid chasing the animals and instead try to lure them into a corral with enticing snacks of grain. They haven\u2019t had any luck, yet, however.-Today August (6) asks me to go fishing before sunset. On the way home he calmly says \u201cdad I saw the zebras\u201d-Something tells me he actually thinks he saw them. So I do a U on Croom Road, pull into some guy\u2019s driveway and\u2026BAM. WILD MARYLAND ZEBRAS @fox5dc @Robert7News pic.twitter.com\/uISFfuPOpS\u2014 Joshua DuBois (@joshuadubois) September 20, 2021 In the meantime, Maryland residents have taken to social media to share their encounters with the animals on the lam, reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post. People have been having fun encountering the animals, with plenty of backyard sightings posted to social media, parents taking their kids zebra hunting, and a nighttime spotting of a zebra crossing the road. (And no, that is not the start of a joke.) Washington, D.C.\u2019s delegate to Congress even released a satirical statement denying responsibility for helping the zebras escape. In the meantime, however, some have started to wonder how a private farm got zebras in the first place. Like many other exotic animals, it turns out that the mammals were legal to own with a permit from the United States Department of Agriculture, per the Post. The owner of these zebras\u2019 former home in fact owns a 39-strong zeal, which is the name for a group of zebras. Another concern at the front of people's minds: what could happen if the zebras are never caught? Could they survive a North American winter? The likely answer is yes, reports Rachel Kurzius of DCist. Some zebras in Africa have been known to live on the high slopes of Mount Kenya, and others have been able to migrate to warmer climates when the temperature drops. \u201cAs with most equids, they have a winter coat. It\u2019ll thicken and keep them warm,\u201d zoologist David Rubenstein of Princeton University told Kurzius. \u201cThey have a high metabolism and as long as they have enough food, that\u2019ll serve as fuel and generate heat to keep them warm.\u201d With plentiful supplies of grass in Maryland and no natural predators, the zebras should be able to survive just fine on their own for as long as they remain free. And as animals prone to running from danger, they most likely shouldn\u2019t present any danger to people who stumble across them. That said, scientists warned folks to keep their distance. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to chase you down,\u201d Taylor told the Post. \u201cBut they are zebras, so they\u2019re not handled by people a lot, so to defend themselves they could bite.\u201d Ben Panko | READ MORE Ben Panko is a staff writer for Smithsonian.com Post a Comment","81":"Researchers at the University of Virginia analyzed county-by-county data on Confederate memorials and lynchings in 11 Southern states between 1832 and 1950. Photo by Drew Angerer \/ Getty Images Last year, amid an outpouring of rage and grief over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, a string of monuments honoring the Confederacy came down across the country. Some were removed by city officials; others were toppled by protesters. Speaking with Fox News last June, then-President Donald Trump spoke out against the push to take these controversial monuments down, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away our heritage and history and the beauty, in many cases, the beauty, the artistic beauty.\u201d It\u2019s an argument oft repeated when public tributes to the Confederacy face removal. These monuments, critics say, represent heritage and Southern pride, and taking them down is tantamount to erasing history. But many others view the monuments as symbols of racism and intimidation, honoring an illegitimate entity that sought to preserve the institutions of white supremacy and slavery. After all, proponents of pulling down statues point out, most Confederate monuments were erected decades after the end of the Civil War, at a time when Black Americans\u2019 civil rights were \u201caggressively under attack,\u201d in the words of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Ryan Best. This map visualizes the researchers' findings, with darker colors denoting higher numbers of lynching victims and each dot representing the location of a Confederate memorialization. Graphic by Samuel Powers \/ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Now, reports Gillian Brockell for the Washington Post, a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences outlines evidence that Confederate monuments are indeed linked to a history of racial violence. Researchers at the University of Virginia (UVA) found that in former Confederate states, counties with higher numbers of Confederate monuments had higher numbers of lynchings between 1832 and 1950\u2014a trend \u201cconsistent with the position that Confederate memorializations reflect a racist history, one marred by intentions to terrorize and intimidate Black Americans in response to Black progress,\u201d according to the study. White mobs committed brutal acts of extrajudicial violence against nearly 2,000 Black Americans during Reconstruction (1865\u20131876), a tumultuous period following the Civil War during which the country\u2019s laws and Constitution were reworked to grant basic rights to the formerly enslaved. These lynchings were \u201cintended to maintain white supremacy, suppress civil rights, instill fear and terrorize Black people,\u201d the authors write in the study. The researchers focused their investigation on the areas where the most lynchings took place: the 11 former Confederate states of Virginia, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas and Alabama. They obtained county-level data on lynching from two sources, including an Equal Justice Initiative registry documenting racially motivated killings that took between 1877 and 1950. County-level counts of Confederate memorials came from the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Whose Heritage? project, which tracks monuments that have been removed and those that still stand. Photograph of the 1913 unveiling of UNC Chapel Hill's Silent Sam monument Public domain via Wikimedia Commons Even when controlling for demographic factors like population numbers, the researchers found that \u201ccounty-level frequency of lynching predicts county-level frequency of Confederate memorializations.\u201d The paper does not make any causal claims, and the researchers \u201ccan\u2019t pinpoint exactly the cause and effect,\u201d says co-author Sophie Trawalter, an expert on public policy and psychology at UVA, in a statement. \u201cBut,\u201d Trawalter adds, \u201cthe association is clearly there. At a minimum, the data suggests that localities with attitudes and intentions that led to lynchings also had attitudes and intentions associated with the construction of Confederate memorials.\u201d The findings become even more powerful, the researchers say, when one considers the times and places that the monuments were erected, as well as the contents of speeches given at the memorials\u2019 dedications. As an example, the paper cites a speech delivered by a Confederate veteran at the 1913 dedication ceremony for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Silent Sam monument. He claimed that Confederate soldiers \u201csaved the very life of the Anglo-Saxon race in the South\u201d and stated that he had publicly whipped a Black woman after the conclusion of the Civil War. Per the paper, the team hopes that its findings, which provide empirical data showing a correlation between Confederate monuments and racial terror killings, will help Americans move on from the debate over controversial statues\u2014and perhaps gain some clarity on how to deal with these public works. \u201cThis kind of [research] is important because it takes a debate that feels like two sides, that feels like two equally valid opinions, and contributes by acknowledging that there are empirical questions at the center of these debates,\u201d first author Kyshia Henderson, a psychologist at UVA, tells Erin O\u2019Hare of Charlottesville Tomorrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to yield to the position that these symbols are not at all associated with hate.

Officials later removed the sculpture, ostensibly for restoration. Photo by Guillermo Guti\u00e9rrez \/ NurPhoto via Getty Images Editor's Note, October 14, 2021: Officials in Mexico City will replace a statue of Christopher Columbus with a monumental replica of The Young Woman of Amajac, a pre-Hispanic limestone sculpture discovered in Mexico\u2019s Huasteca region earlier this year, reports David Agren for the Guardian. The announcement follows widespread criticism of a previously proposed replacement sculpted by artist Pedro Reyes. Read more about Reyes' statue\u2014and the controversial likeness of Columbus\u2014below.A pedestal in the center of Mexico City that once hosted a statue of Christopher Columbus has stood empty since last October. Now, reports Johnny Diaz for the New York Times, a sculpture of an Indigenous woman is set to replace the controversial explorer\u2019s likeness. Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans for the new statue last Sunday, on Mexico\u2019s Day of the Indigenous Woman. Designed by Mexican sculptor Pedro Reyes, the soon-to-be installed statue is titled Tlalli\u2014the Nahuatl word for water. It depicts a woman from the Olmec civilization, which inhabited present-day Mexico between roughly 1400 and 400 B.C.E., as Taylor Dafoe writes for Artnet News. The first major civilization in Mexico, the Olmec are best known today for their massive sculptures of human heads. \u201cIt is very important to dedicate a monument to Indigenous women and to the earth, because if someone can teach us how to take care of this planet, it is our native peoples and that is precisely what we must learn again,\u201d Reyes tells Mexican newspaper El Universal, per a translation by Artnet News. \u201cWe all come from the land and we all return to it, and it is the land that should be in our mind\u2014and not only in the past.\u201d En el marco del #D\u00edaInternacionalDeLaMujerInd\u00edgena anunciamos que en la glorieta donde se ubicaba la estatua de Col\u00f3n, se colocar\u00e1 una escultura que reivindica a las mujeres, de cara a los #500A\u00f1osDeResistenciaInd\u00edgena.#CiudadDeDerechos pic.twitter.com\/4CinthlvDY\u2014 Gobierno CDMX (@GobCDMX) September 5, 2021 Last October, city authorities pulled the 19th-century Columbus statue from its pedestal in the Paseo de la Reforma, a major street that cuts through the heart of Mexico City. Though officials claimed that the work was removed for restoration, some onlookers suspected that the decision was made in anticipation of protests on D\u00eda de la Raza, as Columbus Day is known in Spanish-speaking countries. Protesters routinely defaced the sculpture with spray paint during demonstrations, the Associated Press (AP) reported at the time. Sculpted by French artist Charles Cordier in 1877, the bronze statue depicts Italian explorer Columbus as a conqueror. He stands with one hand raised and the other lifting a veil off of a globe. Columbus\u2019 gesture refers to an outdated history that casts the explorer as the \u201cdiscoverer\u201d of the Americas. In truth, Columbus ventured to the Caribbean in 1492 and met the Ta\u00edno people\u2014one of many civilizations that had been living across North America for tens of thousands of years. The explorer enslaved and killed thousands of Indigenous people; his actions paved the way for European colonization of the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade. A 1909 photograph of the Christopher Columbus statue Public domain via Wikimedia Commons For now, reports the Times, the Columbus statue will be relocated to Parque Am\u00e9rica, in Mexico City\u2019s wealthy Polanco neighborhood. Last year, as protests against racial injustice swept the globe, protesters toppled Columbus statues around the world in symbolic acts of resistance against racism and colonialism. Activists also targeted statues of enslavers and Confederate monuments. At last week\u2019s press conference, Sheinbaum said that a statue honoring Mexicans\u2019 Indigenous heritage was long overdue. \u201cWe\u2019ll place a statue dedicated to the Indigenous woman,\u201d she added, per the Times. \u201cWe owe it to them.

Aspirin does this by thinning out the blood and preventing blood clots from forming, which may block arteries. Getty images The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) released a draft guideline on October 12 stating that a daily regimen of low-dose aspirin is no longer recommended as a preventative measure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems in older adults without heart disease, reports Lindsey Tanner for the Associated Press. Individuals over 60 should not take preventive aspirin because of the age-related risk for life-threatening bleeding. The guidelines are not yet final but may affect tens of millions of adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, reports Roni Caryn Rabin for the New York Times. Ultimately, those currently on a low-dose aspirin regimen or who have cardiovascular risk factors should talk to their doctors about what is best for them. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend anyone stop without talking to a clinician, and definitely not if they have already had a heart attack or stroke,\u201d says Chien-Wen Tseng, a USPTF member and a University of Hawaii research director, to the New York Times. The report also states that those aged between 40 and 60 and worried about their heart health should decide to take aspirin on a case-by-case basis, reports Ed Cara for Gizmodo. The panel consists of 16 medicine and disease prevention experts who evaluate evidence-based preventative measures and screening tests. Panel members are appointed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Low-dose aspirin or baby aspirin (81 to 100 milligrams) has previously been recommended as a safe and cheap way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. Aspirin does this by thinning out the blood and preventing blood clots from forming, per the New York Times. The drug seems to most help individuals who already have, or are at a high risk for, cardiovascular disease. The panel found some evidence that baby aspirin may only benefit people between 40 and 60 years of age who have a 10 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke, per the Associated Press. However, aspirin can also cause life-threatening bleeding in the digestive tract or brain, per the New York Times. One study published in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of bleeding from an aspirin regimen outweighs its potential benefits for those over 70 years of age, Gizmodo reports. The USPTF made their assessments based on a literature review of data from recent trials and population studies. For older people who have no risks of heart disease, the potential for bleeding damage outweighs any aspirin benefits. \u201cWhen we looked at the literature, most of it suggested the net balance is not favorable for most people \u2014 there was more bleeding than heart attacks prevented,\u201d says Amit Khera, an author of the guideline, to the New York Times. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t nose bleeds, this can be bleeding in the brain.\u201d The draft recommendation statement is currently open for public comment until November 8, before a final version of the report Is published, the New York Times reports. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a blanket statement that everybody who\u2019s at increased risk for heart disease, even though they never had a heart attack, should be on aspirin,\u201d Tseng explains to the New York Times. \u201cWe need to be smarter at matching primary prevention to the people who will benefit the most and have the least risk of harm.\u201d Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Each day, she peered inside the windows and watched the animators at work\u2014until someone took notice of her and invited her inside. \u201cI think it was Walt [Disney] because he roamed around quite a bit,\u201d Tompson later recalled. She became such a fixture at the studio that Walt\u2019s brother, Roy, brought an apple box for her to sit on, transfixed, as animations came to life around her. \u201c[A]s it got late, he would say, \u2018I think you\u2019d better go home. Your mother probably wants you to come home for dinner.\u2019\u201d These visits marked the start of Tompson\u2019s long, fruitful association with the Walt Disney Company. After graduating from high school, she formally joined the studio as an inker and painter, transferring animators\u2019 drawings from paper onto \u201ccels,\u201d or celluloid sheets used in the filmmaking process. Over the next 40-odd years, she took on roles in final check, scene planning and the camera department. Her work\u2014\u201dlargely unheralded,\u201d writes Margalit Fox for the New York Times\u2014helped shape many of the beloved children\u2019s films produced during Disney\u2019s Golden Age, among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. Tompson retired from Disney in 1975. Walt Disney Company On October 10, at the age of 111, Tompson \u201cpassed away peacefully in her sleep\u201d at her home in the Motion Picture and Television Fund\u2019s retirement community in Woodland Hills, California, Disney announced in a statement. \u201cRuthie was a legend among animators,\u201d says Bob Iger, executive chairman of the Walt Disney Company, in the statement. \u201cWhile we will miss her smile and wonderful sense of humor, her exceptional work and pioneering spirit will forever be an inspiration to us all.\u201d Born in Portland, Maine, in 1910, Tompson moved to California with her family when she was 8 years old. Her childhood was suffused with Disney: She lived down the street from Robert Disney, Walt\u2019s uncle, and in addition to being a regular observer of the Disney film studio, appeared as a live-action reference model for an early series of shorts, the Alice Comedies. She received 25 to 50 cents for each picture and used the money to buy licorice. When she was 18, Tompson took a job at a riding academy in the San Fernando Valley, where the Disney brothers often played polo. Though he had not seen her since she was a child, Walt recognized her \u201csignature Buster Brown haircut,\u201d and invited her to work with him, wrote Patricia Zohn for Vanity Fair in 2010. Tompson replied that she couldn\u2019t \u201cdraw worth a nickel,\u201d but Disney was undeterred, promising that the studio would send her to night school so she could learn the craft of inking and painting. The first film Tompson worked on was the studio\u2019s first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She joined a group of about 100 women, some of them \u201cprofoundly gifted artists\u201d who were barred from animation jobs because of their gender, per the Times. Tompson didn\u2019t have the steady, delicate touch needed to work with the inkers, who \u201cnot only had to trace the animators\u2019 pencil lines exactly but also had to capture the feeling of what the animators were intending in the scenes,\u201d according to the Walt Disney Family Museum. Instead, she was assigned to paint in the lines that had been traced by the inkers. Soon, Tompson was promoted to the position of final checker, making her responsible for reviewing animation cels before they were photographed onto film. \u201cOut of a 500-cel scene, every four or five would be painted by a different girl, so the colors had to follow through,\u201d she explained in 2007. \u201cIf they put blue in the wrong place, we\u2019d have to take them back and have them redo them.\u201d In 1948, Tompson began working as both an animation checker reviewing artists\u2019 work for inconsistencies and a scene planner\u2014a role that required her to guide how the camera should move to bring vitality to the animations. Tompson was named a Disney legend in 2000. Walt Disney Company \u201cShe really had to know all the mechanics of making the image work on the screen as the director, the layout person and the animator preferred: how to make Peter Pan walk, or fly, in the specified time,\u201d John Canemaker, a historian and Oscar-winning animator, tells the Times. \u201cWhat she did ended up on the screen\u2014whether you see her hand or not\u2014because of the way she supported the directors\u2019 vision.\u201d Though she operated behind the scenes, Tompson\u2019s technical skill was recognized when she became one of the first three women admitted to the International Photographers Union, reports Rachel Treisman for NPR. She continued working for Disney until her retirement from the studio in 1975, making invaluable contributions to \u201cvirtually every Disney animated feature up through The Rescuers,\u201d per the statement. In 2000, Tompson was named a Disney Legend, a title bestowed for exceptional contributions to the company. Last year, in honor of Tompson\u2019s 110th birthday, a celebration was held at the Motion Picture & Television Fund campus. Staff decorated the halls according to Tompson\u2019s two passions: Disney and the Dodgers. When asked the secret to her longevity, Tompson joked that she was a vampire before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am still here, but I know that I don\u2019t want to be revered for how old I am.

The spotted spawn were born within a span of six hours\u20145:20, 8:24, 9:42, 10:33 and 11:17 a.m. ET.

As webcam viewers watch our cheetah family grow, play and explore their surroundings, we hope the experience brings them joy and helps them feel a deeper connection to this vulnerable species.\u201d With less than 7,500 cheetahs in the wild, the species has been labeled \u201cvulnerable to extinction\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Cheetahs live in small, isolated populations mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where their numbers are being decimated by human conflict, poaching, and habitat and prey-base loss, according to the SCBI statement. Since 2007, 16 litters of cheetah cubs have been born at SCBI, including a family of four in 2020. In September, SCBI staff took over care of a day-old cub that was abandoned by its mother due to lack of milk stimulation. The baby was bottle-fed by hand for 17 days until it could be sent to an adoptive mother cheetah at a breeding facility in Oregon, where it is now thriving. SCBI is part of the Cheetah Breeding Center Coalition\u2014a group of ten breeding centers across the United States that maintain a sustainable North American cheetah population under human care, reports the Washingtonian. Crosier coordinates the effort through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 Cheetah Species Survival Plan, which she heads. SCBI spearheads research programs at its headquarters in Virginia, National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and field research stations and training sites worldwide. Scientists at the facility tackle complex conservation challenges by applying knowledge of animal behavior and reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration and conservation sustainability, the SCBI statement says. Mom and her babies can be viewed on the cheetah cam until the cubs leave the den. The new family has access to other areas at the facility, so it is possible they may be off-camera if they go out and explore. Genders of the cute cubs are not known at this time since SCBI keepers have not been able to examine the brood in person yet. Rosalie is doing well, though is understandably tired after giving birth to the five cheetah cherubs. The father, ten-year-old Nick was the first cheetah ever born at SCBI.

NurPhoto via Getty Images Earlier this week pharmaceutical company Merck announced it has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use of what could be the first-ever pill to treat Covid-19. Because the antiviral drug can be delivered in series of convenient and relatively inexpensive capsules, some experts say it could be a game-changer in the fight against the virus. If the pill is approved by the FDA\u2014which could happen in a matter of weeks\u2014millions of Americans could be eligible to receive it. All other approved Covid-19 treatments must be delivered intravenously or injected by a medical professional, while the capsule could be taken at home as soon as symptoms appear. The pill, which contains the antiviral drug molnupiravir, won\u2019t be a fix-all for the pandemic, but it will provide public health experts with another tool in their arsenal. Experts say vaccinations are the best way to protect oneself from infection, but the new antiviral medication provides a better shot for those that do fall ill. Around 68 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, underscoring the need for safe and effective treatments for Covid-19 infections. \u201cThe value here is that it\u2019s a pill so you don\u2019t have to deal with the infusion centers and all the factors around that,\u201d says Nicholas Kartsonis, a senior vice president with Merck\u2019s infectious disease unit, to Matthew Perrone of the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful tool to add to the toolbox.\u201d The drug molnupiravir, which was first tested for influenza, works by interfering with the way SARS-CoV-2 replicates inside our cells, causing mutations that kill the virus. In the company\u2019s clinical trials, they reported that the pill halved hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated adults infected with Covid-19. The study group included adults who were already showing symptoms and were at a high risk of severe disease. The company says it\u2019s seeking authorization for its pill to be given only to high-risk adults, like those over 60 or with other risk factors like obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. The results are not peer-reviewed, and the FDA will examine Merck\u2019s studies on the drug before making a decision, reports Cassandra Willyard for Nature. Eventually, the FDA could approve the drug for lower-risk Americans, too. The medication isn\u2019t a one-and-done pill: the company says people will have to take four pills twice a day for five days, for a total of 40 capsules. Merck, which is developing the pill with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, anticipates producing enough pills for 10 million people by the end of this year. A similar antiviral pill being developed by Pfizer and Atea Pharmaceuticals-Roche, reports Rebecca Robbins for the New York Times. The new medication could also provide relief to over-burdened hospitals, especially in places where vaccination rates are still low. The pills cost about a third of the price of intravenous monoclonal antibody treatments with a price tag of around $700 USD per patient, but that may still be too costly for some nations. \u201cAre we going to be in a situation where the price is reasonable in low- and middle-income countries?\u201d says Rachel Cohen, the North American executive director at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, to Nature. If those countries are able to get a supply of molnupiravir, they often lack the recourses needed to spot infections early. Because Merck\u2019s pill must be taken within the first five days of showing symptoms, \u201cthat requires that we are able to actually rapidly diagnose people,\u201d Cohen says, which \u201cis actually a huge challenge.\u201d Because clinical trials included only high-risk, unvaccinated people, it\u2019s not clear if the pill will be available to vaccinated people. A company spokeswoman said it would be up to the FDA to decide, according to the New York Times. Because of the way the drug works to kill the virus, people who are pregnant will not be eligible to receive the pills due to the risk of birth defects.

Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images The drought facing much of the American West is hurting the region\u2019s ability to generate electricity by throttling the water flowing through hydroelectric power plants, reports Michael Phillis for the Associated Press. A new report from the Energy Information Administration projects that because of the severe drought, hydropower generation will decline by nearly 14 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. California had to shut down Oroville Lake\u2019s Hyatt Power Plant in August when water levels dropped too low. At Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the Utah-Arizona border, water levels have plunged so low that the United States Bureau of Reclamation projects that the lake may no longer have enough water to generate electricity by 2023 if drought conditions persist, reports Dan Gearino for Inside Climate News. Losing Lake Powell\u2019s Glen Canyon Dam would require utility companies to find a new way to get electricity to the 5.8 million customers the dam currently supplies with power. Hydropower generation produces 7.3 percent of U.S. electricity. When that power supply falls short, states are likely to make up the difference by burning fossil fuels that exacerbate climate change, per Inside Climate. For example, California\u2019s hydropower has declined 38 percent compared to 2020 and in response, the state is expected to boost natural gas power by 7 percent, the AP reports. In the Pacific Northwest, the hydropower shortfall is predicted to increase coal power generation by 12 percent. Given all this, Inside Climate\u2019s Gearino poses the question of whether this means hydropower is becoming a less reliable power source as the U.S. tries to transition to using more renewable energy. Unsatisfyingly, the answer appears to be that we don\u2019t yet know. While temperatures are assuredly rising, the climate change\u2013driven changes in precipitation will vary significantly by region. But when severe drought and extreme heat collide, as they have this year, states like California that rely heavily on hydropower can be forced to buy extra power to meet demand, which tends to spike when temperatures soar, per the AP. Still, this year\u2019s drop in hydropower generation is not without precedent. Per Inside Climate, 2007 saw a 14.4 percent drop and in 2012 hydropower generation fell by 13.5 percent. But the fluctuations highlight the ways in which the extremes brought about by climate change are stressing human infrastructure and creating added challenges when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels.

FlickrDelusions via Flickr under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 The University of Oxford\u2019s Oriel College has installed a plaque identifying 19th-century politician and diamond-mining magnate Cecil Rhodes as a \u201ccommitted British colonialist.\u201d Placed beside a much-debated statue of Rhodes, the plaque immediately came under fire from both advocates of removing the sculpture and their opponents. Oxford city councilor Shaista Aziz, who was a member of the college\u2019s Independent Commission of Inquiry into the statue, calls the plaque \u201camateurish\u201d and \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d reports Indya Clayton for the Oxford Mail. Aziz adds that the sign does \u201cnothing to address the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, a loud, proud white supremacist, colonialist and slave owner and a deeply controversial figure of his time.\u201d The new plaque notes that the building where the statue stands was constructed with money bequeathed by Rhodes in his will. Upon his death in 1902, Rhodes, a former Oriel student, left the college the equivalent of about $17 million in today\u2019s dollars. The plaque states that Rhodes \"obtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\" Dan Hicks via Twitter Per the sign, Rhodes \u201cobtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\u201d Though the college \u201cdeclared its wish to remove the statue\u201d following widespread protests against systemic racism last year, it opted not to do so in accordance with \u201clegal and regulatory advice.\u201d A line at the bottom of the plaque directs readers to a website featuring additional context about the statue and Rhodes himself. Cambridge historian David Abulafia tells the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Turner that the sign \u201clacks balance.\u201d \u201cHe believed he was bringing benefits to Africa,\u201d Abulafia says. \u201cWe might now argue that he did more harm than good, but one has to understand what his intentions were. He is portrayed here as some sort of devil incarnate.\u201dAs an @OrielOxford alumnus I am dismayed to see the sniveling cowardice shown in the face of the left-wing mob. Like many other Oriel graduates I am grateful for the education I received at Oxford in large part due to the generosity of Rhodes' bequest. https:\/\/t.co\/s1jsZKSy8r\u2014 Nile Gardiner (@NileGardiner) October 10, 2021 For more than a year, the Oxford statue has been a target of the Rhodes Must Fall movement, which began as a series of student-led protests in South Africa in 2015, as Justin Parkinson reported for BBC News at the time. Linking Rhodes\u2019 legacy to continuing inequity in wealth and opportunities in the country, protesters successfully campaigned for the removal of a prominent statue of Rhodes at the University of Cape Town. Founder of the De Beers diamond company, Rhodes served as prime minister of Britain\u2019s Cape Colony, in what\u2019s now South Africa, from 1890 to 1896. In addition to profiting enormously from the region\u2019s mineral wealth, Rhodes advocated for monumental expansion of the British Empire, including bringing the United States back under British control. He sought to create a \u201cred line\u201d on the map of Africa, with everything from Cairo to Cape Town belonging to Britain. \u201cI contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race,\u201d Rhodes once said. Last year, in the midst of global activism following the police killing of George Floyd, activists in Oxford demanded the removal of Rhode\u2019s likeness. Protesters around the world also toppled statues of other figures linked to slavery and colonialism, including Confederate generals and enslavers. In Bristol, an English city west of Oxford, a crowd dumped a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston into a nearby harbor.the Rhodes Must Fall Oxford campaign did not, from memory, call for the erection of a third college memorial to Cecil Rhodesthis small metal sign is an embarrassment and reveals the incoherence and futility of the ideology of \u201cRetain and Explain\u201d pic.twitter.com\/Ft50hPpVQ4\u2014 Dan Hicks (@profdanhicks) October 11, 2021 A majority of the independent commission\u2019s members supported removing Oriel\u2019s Rhodes statue. But the college decided in May that it would not do so, citing the difficult legal and planning process involved, per Jamie Grierson and Damien Gayle of the Guardian. According to the Oxford Mail, the new plaque is a temporary measure that will eventually be replaced with a permanent response to the controversy. In January, United Kingdom officials announced a new \u201cretain and explain\u201d policy that keeps controversial historical statues in place with added context. This week, the City of London Corporation announced that memorials to William Beckford and John Cass, politicians with ties to the transatlantic slave trade, would remain standing alongside new explanatory texts, reports Taylor Dafoe for Artnet News. \u201cIt enables us to acknowledge and address the legacy of our past with openness and honesty,\u201d says Doug Barrow, chair of a subcommittee that considered the Beckford and Cass statues, in a statement. \u201cNot to try and erase history but to place it in its proper context.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, eleventh Duke of Devonshire For decades, an unsettling portrait of Yale University\u2019s namesake and early benefactor, British American colonist Elihu Yale, carried a maddeningly incomplete description. The painting shows four white men in costly 18th-century outfits posing around a table, with Yale at the center. As the men smoke and sip madeira, Yale\u2019s grandchildren play in the field behind them. In the right corner of the canvas, a child of African descent pours wine for the group. He wears fine red and grey clothes and\u2014most disturbingly\u2014a silver collar locked around his neck. First donated to the Yale Center for British Art (YCBA) in 1970 and exhibited sporadically over the past five decades, the painting was initially displayed with wall text that listed the men\u2019s titles but did not mention the enslaved child at their side. When the gallery was rehung in 2016, a new line acknowledged little beyond the boy\u2019s apparel: \u201cNothing is known ... except that his livery identifies him as a servant, and the padlocked collar indicates that he is enslaved.\u201d A boy of African descent, estimated to be about 10 years old, serves madeira to the wealthy white men at the table. Public domain via Yale Center for British Art \/ Gift of Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire Unanswered questions about the enslaved child haunted New Haven resident Titus Kaphar when he first saw the portrait in 2016. Inspired, the artist painted Enough About You, which warps the 18th-century work beyond recognition, save for the boy\u2019s portrait, which is framed in gold. Kaphar\u2019s subject stares directly at the viewer and does not wear a collar. As the artist told Terence Trouillot of Artnet Newsin 2019, \u201cI decided to physically take action to quiet [and crumple] the side of the painting that we\u2019ve been talking about for a very long time and turn up the volume on this kid\u2019s story.\u201d Four years after Kaphar created Enough About You, the YCBA embarked on a project to do just that. Last fall, after a landmark summer of protests against racial injustice, director Courtney J. Martin decided to temporarily remove the Yale group portrait from view. The museum hung Kaphar\u2019s painting, on an eight-month loan from private collectors in California, in its place. Meanwhile, a group of five YCBA employees volunteered to research the enslaved child and his portrait in new depth. Software engineer Eric James, senior curatorial assistant Abigail Lamphier, senior library assistant Lori Misura, coordinator of cataloging David K. Thompson and assistant curator Edward Town published their initial findings online earlier this year. Viewers can explore the report via the YCBA website and the related Yale and Slavery Research Project website. As of this week, members of the public can once again view the reinstalled Yale portrait, bolstered by rewritten wall texts that add newfound historical context to the image, as Nancy Kenney reports for the Art Newspaper. \u201cHow long will it stay [up]? That\u2019s the answer I don\u2019t have just yet,\u201d Martin tells the Art Newspaper. \u201cThe conversation is evolving.\u201d Titus Kaphar, Enough About You, 2016 Photo by Richard Caspole \/ Collection of Arthur Lewis and Hau Nguyen \/ Courtesy of the artist The painting\u2019s new label holds several revelations from the researchers. Whereas previous estimates had dated the portrait to 1708, chemical analysis conducted in the past year now suggests that it was completed around 1719. The experts also ascribed the formerly unattributed work to John Verelst, a Dutch portraitist working in Britain during that period, and retitled it Elihu Yale With Members of His Family and an Enslaved Child. Though the team has yet to uncover the identity of the Black child, Town tells Smithsonian that he still has hope. Scholars sometimes argue that European artists did not paint people of African or Indian descent from real-life models but instead invented from fabricated stereotypes\u2014an assumption that strikes Town as \u201cunsatisfying and wrong.\u201d \u201cThe full story hasn\u2019t yet been told,\u201d he says. Recovering the child\u2019s biography \u201cmight prove impossible, but it is still the goal here.\u201d Despite lacking a name for the child, the YCBA team has managed to flesh out some details of his life and status. Based on input from pediatricians, the team estimates that he was about 10 years old. He would have been one of many people, mostly boys under the age of 10, taken from their families in British colonies in Africa and India and forced to work as enslaved \u201cpages\u201d in the households of wealthy white men. (This work in particular was probably painted at Yale\u2019s house in London.) The child\u2019s enslavers also forced him to wear a padlocked collar. As the Art Newspaper reports, this was a common practice: YCBA researchers have identified at least 50 other paintings made in Britain between 1660 and 1760 that depict enslaved individuals wearing similar collars, sometimes engraved with an enslaver\u2019s name or other identifying marks. \u201cThis collar is not used to tether someone to another set of chains, in the way that a similar-looking object would be in Jamaica or Barbados at the same time,\u201d says Town. Rather, \u201c[o]ne of the invidious, cruelest things about it is that these collars would have been highly finished, high-status objects.\u201d As instruments of control, the bands symbolically marked their wearers as enslaved and prevented them from easily running away. Town is careful to qualify that the precise details of this child\u2019s bondage would have differed from the experiences of enslaved people in the British colonies, where slavery was codified by law. Chattel slavery technically had \u201cno legal basis\u201d in England, per Historic U.K. But many Black people were forced to work in British households in \u201can ill-defined but often violently enforced state of what historians have characterized as \u2018slavish servitude,\u2019\u201d the researchers write. (The slippery legal semantics around enslavement within Britain\u2019s shoreline would later be tested in court, most notably in the 1772 case of James Somerset, adds Town.) The child\u2019s precise relationship with the four men in the painting is likewise unclear. Some clues have come to light: for instance, the man standing at Yale\u2019s shoulder is newly identified as David Yale, the patriarch\u2019s adopted heir. He looms over Lord James Cavendish, to the left of Yale, and a figure now identified as Yale\u2019s son-in-law William Cavendish, on the right. In other words, this is a family portrait that Yale likely commissioned near the end of his life to promote his power and legacy, says Town. Born in 1649 in Boston, the merchant made his fortune during a 20-year tenure working for (and stealing from) the East India Company in present-day Chennai (then called Madras). He later retired in luxury to Wales and England. In 1718, he donated a set of expensive goods to the future Yale University, lending the young Connecticut college its name. Town and historian Teanu Reid note that the extent of Yale\u2019s direct involvement in the trade of enslaved people remains unclear. But other scholars argue that he certainly would have benefited and profited from the trade indirectly, as Mark Alden Branch reported for Yale Alumni magazine last year. No known written records prove that Yale personally enslaved people. His private papers are missing\u2014a fact that further complicates efforts to determine how the young boy ended up painted into a group portrait. This lack of a paper trail means that researchers can\u2019t say for certain whether Yale or one of his relatives claimed ownership of the child. That being said, \u201c[f]or me, it\u2019s splitting hairs, because they\u2019re all one social and economic and familial unit,\u201d says Town. James Worsdale painted this work, Elihu Yale With His Servant, sometime in the 18th century. The painting was removed from public display in 2007. Public domain via Yale University Art Gallery Research into the boy\u2019s identity and story is ongoing. Archivists are currently investigating regional archives located near the estates of Yale and his sons-in-law, who owned properties in Suffolk, Buckinghamshire and Derbyshire, for clues about their lives, businesses and households, per the Art Newspaper. While Yale\u2019s relationship to the institution of slavery is subject to historical debate, he was certainly comfortable sitting for portraits that featured enslaved people. Of the seven painted likenesses of Yale in the university\u2019s holdings, three depict him alongside an enslaved person: the aforementioned family portrait attributed to Verelst, a rendition of the same group on copper and a separate full-length portrait that once hung in the university\u2019s Corporation Room. The last of these, which was removed from public view in 2007 due to its racist themes, shows an enslaved adult of Indian or South Asian heritage walking up to Yale and holding out a letter. The artist, James Worsdale, attempts to marginalize the figure of the servant, depicting him as emerging from the shadows and rendering him as slight compared to Yale\u2019s imposing bulk. Similarly, Verelst painted the young African boy in the corner of his group composition. In a 2014 YCBA exhibition, curators asked attendees to disobey these visual cues and instead consider the enslaved child in the portrait as if he were the focus of the work. As Kaphar demonstrated with Enough About You, artists can encourage members of the public to \u201creframe\u201d portraits like Elihu Yale, literally and figuratively. \u201cI wanted to find a way to imagine a life for this young man that the historical painting had never made space for in the composition: his desires, dreams, family, thoughts, hopes,\u201d Kaphar told Artnet News in 2019. \u201cThose things were never subjects that the original artist wanted the viewer to contemplate.\u201d Nora McGreevy | | READ MORE Nora McGreevy is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.

(Pictured: A shooting star streaks across a starry sky in British Columbia; image is not associated with the incident.)

She was on the telephone with an emergency operator when she noticed a dark gray rock behind her pillows that matched the fist-sized hole in her ceiling. The police officer who visited Hamilton\u2019s home in Golden, British Columbia, first suspected a nearby construction site might have been to blame for the projectile. But there was no blasting at the site that night. Instead, the construction workers tipped the officer off to another explanation. They heard booming and saw an explosion in the sky just before Hamilton reported the impact. \u201cThe police officer came back in and said: \u2018Well, I think you have meteorite in your bed,\u2019\" says Hamilton to CTV News Vancouver\u2019s David Molko. The meteorite weighs about 2.8 pounds and is the size of a large adult fist, per John Yoon and Vjosa Isai at the New York Times. Hamilton shared the meteorite with researchers at the University of Western Ontario, which has a collection of meteorites, so they can study the extraterrestrial intruder. \"It's certainly a meteorite,\" says University of Western Ontario meteor physicist Peter Brown to CBC News. \"Everything about the story was consistent with a meteorite fall, and the fact that this bright fireball had occurred basically right at the same time made it a pretty overwhelming case.\" The researchers plan to to gather images, measurements and possibly samples of the meteorite, per CTV News. They are also asking residents near Golden to check for video, such as dash cam footage, from October 3 at 11:33 p.m. that may have captured a glimpse of the fireball. Researchers can use video to reconstruct the path that the meteorite followed from the asteroid belt to Earth, says Brown to the Vancouver Sun. On average, fewer than ten meteorites are recovered each year; most meteors burn up in the atmosphere, and many land in the wilderness or the ocean. But just last year, a meteorite crash-landed in an Indonesian home, Andreas Illmer reported for BBC News at the time. Only one person, Ann Hodges, has ever survived a meteorite strike. Like Hamilton, Hodges was at home when the meteorite burst through the ceiling. The nine-pound meteorite bounced off a radio and hit Hodges\u2019 thigh, leaving a deep bruise.

Though the bears are reaching peak fatness this week, Fat Bear Week is an entire summer of eating in the making. The bears eat around 90 pounds of fish, berries, small mammals, and vegetation each day to pack on the pounds necessary to survive months of winter hibernation. They\u2019ll lose over a third of their body fat during their winter snooze, which lasts about six months.

Pictured here is an adult male African lion, Luke. Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute Editor's Note, October 15, 2021: A month after lions and tigers at Smithsonian's National Zoo received presumptive positive Covid-19 diagnoses, the big cats continue to recover well. The lions and tigers are behaving, eating and drinking normally, according to a National Zoo statement. This week, several species susceptible to contracting the coronavirus received animal-specific vaccines, including all seven orangutans, one western lowland gorilla, one white-eared titi monkey and two emperor tamarins received shots. The big cats will be vaccinated 90 days after they were first infected with the virus.When big cats started coughing and sneezing, staff at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., became concerned. Testing showed their worst fears were true: presumptive positive results for the virus that causes Covid-19. Final results of testing are expected in the next few days. Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers are now being treated for the virus. The sick cats are receiving antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication. In addition to respiratory distress, the animals are also showing signs of lethargy and reduced weight from decreased appetites, according to National Zoo statement. Zoo officials say the public is not at risk of contracting Covid-19 from the big cats \u201cgiven the substantial distance between the animals and visitors,\u201d reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post. No other animals at the National Zoo are \u201cshowing any signs of infection,\u201d the article also states. Just how the lions and tigers contracted the virus is unknown. The zoo\u2019s existing Covid-19 protocols restrict behind-the-scenes access in all animal areas and require staff to use personal protective equipment while maintaining hygiene, cleaning, self-screening and health management. Safety and response protocols are being strictly followed, zoo officials state. \u201cWhile it is possible the infection was transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, it has been standard practice for all animal care staff and essential staff to mask indoors in all public and non-public areas,\u201d the National Zoo statement says. \u201cThe health and vaccination status of employees is confidential medical information.\u201d Animals at a number of zoos across the country have become ill with the Covid-19 virus.

Laurent Ballesta\/Wildlife Photographer of the Year The winning images from this year\u2019s prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards capture an up-close encounter with an elusive spider, a magical undersea kept forest, and a glimpse from a hungry grizzly at mealtime. The 2021 award winners were revealed in an online ceremony held this week by the London\u2019s Natural History Museum, which organizes the annual competition and hosts an exhibit of the winning images. The international panel of judges selected winning images from more than 50,000 entries from nearly 100 different counties. The competition, which has been running for 57 years, awards prizes in 19 categories of wildlife photography, including animal behavior, plants and fungi, and animal portraiture. This year\u2019s winners were chosen for \u201ctheir artistic composition, technical innovation and truthful interpretation of the natural world,\u201d according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. The 2021 grand prize winner, French photographer and biologist Laurent Ballesta, spent more than 3,000 hours trying to capture his stunning undersea image of mating groupers, reports Natasha Daly for National Geographic. Groupers\u2014large, stout fish\u2014mate just once a year for less than 30 minutes. Under the light of the full moon each July, the male and female fish each release a cloud of sperm or eggs. Ballesta and his team returned to the same lagoon in French Polynesia every year for five years to finally capture the image, which is titled \u201cCreation.\u201d Ballesta\u2019s photograph captures \u201ca magical moment,\u201d said Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the judging panel, in a press release. \u201cIt is surprising, energetic, and intriguing, and has an otherworldly beauty.\u201d The region of French Polynesia where Ballesta captured the image of the mating groupers, Fakarava Atoll, is a protected UNESCO Biosphere Reserve that provides habitat to several threatened and endangered species, including vast coral reefs and bird species. Outside the reserve, however, overfishing and habitat loss pose a serious threat to the region\u2019s wildlife. The image is \u201ca compelling reminder of what we stand to lose if we do not address humanity's impact on our planet,\" said London's Natural History Museum director Doug Gurr.

In France, kids can choose between receiving a sustainable toy or a book in the \"One Book or One Toy\" program with their Happy Meal. David Paul Morris\/Getty Images Since launching the first Happy Meal in 1979, McDonald's has churned out iconic Happy Meal toys year after year\u2014from McFurbys to dozens of Disney characters. Now, the McDonald's Happy Meal is about to undergo a more sustainable update. Last month, McDonald's announced that by the end of 2025, every Happy Meal toy sold around the world would be more eco-friendly and consist of renewable and recycled materials. The change from traditional plastic toys should result in a 90 percent reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use, according to a statement. This amount is comparable to 650,000 people not using plastic for a year, Bill Chappell reports for NPR. \"With this transition for our toys, we're working closely with suppliers, families, and play experts and engineers to introduce more sustainable, innovative designs and help drive demand for recycled materials, to keep McDonald's communities and beyond smiling for generations to come,\" Jenny McColloch, the Chief Sustainability Officer for McDonald's, said in a statement. New sustainable toys will feature buildable 3-D paper figures and other toys made from plant-derived materials or recycled plastic, reports Insider's Cheryl Teh. The change to more eco-friendly toys is already underway in some countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. In France, kids can choose between receiving a sustainable toy or a book in the \"One Book or One Toy\" program with their Happy Meal, report Deema Zein and Julia Griffin for PBS News Hour. However, some experts say that while reducing the number of plastic toys is the first step, the fast-food giant is only scratching the surface. \"Given that McDonald's is one of the world's largest franchising brands, more can be done in terms of other operations, like reducing their carbon footprint while moving products across supply chains,\" Sharon Seah, a climate change expert at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told Insider. Seah explained to Insider that McDonald's could offer more vegan or plant-based options on their menu to reduce beef consumption. Other fast-food chains, like Burger King and Qdoba, already offer plant-based meat options like the Impossible Whopper and other Impossible-brand meat options for burritos and tacos, Erica Chayes Wida reports for Today. McDonald's sells more than a billion pounds of beef in the United States alone, per Insider. In 2018, cattle, sheep, and goat farming produced 178 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, per the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems. Aside from switching out plastic toys for cardboard ones, McDonald's aims to reduce their packaging waste. By 2025, McDonald's plans to obtain 100 percent of its guest packaging from recycled sources and recycle the packaging in all its restaurants, NPR reports. Currently, the company has reached 80 percent of this goal. \"By reducing conventional virgin plastic inputs by a projected 90 percent, the re-imagined toys will reduce the demand on fossil fuel plastic production to instead create new markets for responsibly-sourced renewable and recycled content,\" said Sheila Bonini, the Senior Vice President at World Wildlife Fund, in a McDonald's statement. \"And through its immense reach of these toys, McDonald's can engage its millions of daily customers around the world in the transition to a more sustainable, circular future.\" Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

(Pictured: A zebra stands in a field of yellow flowers in Namibia.) Westend61 via Getty Images Editor's Note, October 15, 2021: Prince George County officials publicly announced one of the rogue zebras was found dead at a private residence on September 16 after getting caught in a small animal snare, the Washington Post reports. Initially, officials had reported five zebras missing, when in fact only three had escaped. Now, only two remain at large. The zebras first escaped on August 30 from an 80-acre farm off Duley Station Road in Upper Marlboro. Imagine looking out into your backyard and seeing zebras: It sounds like something out of a dream or a trippy song from the 1970s. But for the past month, it\u2019s been reality for residents of suburban Maryland. It all started on August 31, when five of the striped mammals escaped from a private farm in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, reports Michael Levenson of the New York Times. \u201cWhen I first heard about it I was like, \u2018OK, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me, right? Zebras?\u2019\u201d Rodney Taylor, chief of the Prince George\u2019s County Animal Services Division, told Levenson. In four decades of catching runaway animals, this would be his first experience going after the equine species. As it turns out, catching zebras is a pretty tricky endeavor. Having evolved to escape predators such as lions on the flat savannah and grasslands of Africa, zebras can run very fast at a moment\u2019s notice. Because of the animal's instinct to flee, animal control officials avoid chasing the animals and instead try to lure them into a corral with enticing snacks of grain. They haven\u2019t had any luck, yet, however.-Today August (6) asks me to go fishing before sunset. On the way home he calmly says \u201cdad I saw the zebras\u201d-Something tells me he actually thinks he saw them. So I do a U on Croom Road, pull into some guy\u2019s driveway and\u2026BAM. WILD MARYLAND ZEBRAS @fox5dc @Robert7News pic.twitter.com\/uISFfuPOpS\u2014 Joshua DuBois (@joshuadubois) September 20, 2021 In the meantime, Maryland residents have taken to social media to share their encounters with the animals on the lam, reports Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post. People have been having fun encountering the animals, with plenty of backyard sightings posted to social media, parents taking their kids zebra hunting, and a nighttime spotting of a zebra crossing the road. (And no, that is not the start of a joke.) Washington, D.C.\u2019s delegate to Congress even released a satirical statement denying responsibility for helping the zebras escape. In the meantime, however, some have started to wonder how a private farm got zebras in the first place. Like many other exotic animals, it turns out that the mammals were legal to own with a permit from the United States Department of Agriculture, per the Post. The owner of these zebras\u2019 former home in fact owns a 39-strong zeal, which is the name for a group of zebras. Another concern at the front of people's minds: what could happen if the zebras are never caught? Could they survive a North American winter? The likely answer is yes, reports Rachel Kurzius of DCist. Some zebras in Africa have been known to live on the high slopes of Mount Kenya, and others have been able to migrate to warmer climates when the temperature drops. \u201cAs with most equids, they have a winter coat. It\u2019ll thicken and keep them warm,\u201d zoologist David Rubenstein of Princeton University told Kurzius. \u201cThey have a high metabolism and as long as they have enough food, that\u2019ll serve as fuel and generate heat to keep them warm.\u201d With plentiful supplies of grass in Maryland and no natural predators, the zebras should be able to survive just fine on their own for as long as they remain free. And as animals prone to running from danger, they most likely shouldn\u2019t present any danger to people who stumble across them. That said, scientists warned folks to keep their distance. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to chase you down,\u201d Taylor told the Post. \u201cBut they are zebras, so they\u2019re not handled by people a lot, so to defend themselves they could bite.\u201d Ben Panko | READ MORE Ben Panko is a staff writer for Smithsonian.com Post a Comment","96":"Researchers at the University of Virginia analyzed county-by-county data on Confederate memorials and lynchings in 11 Southern states between 1832 and 1950. Photo by Drew Angerer \/ Getty Images Last year, amid an outpouring of rage and grief over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, a string of monuments honoring the Confederacy came down across the country. Some were removed by city officials; others were toppled by protesters. Speaking with Fox News last June, then-President Donald Trump spoke out against the push to take these controversial monuments down, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away our heritage and history and the beauty, in many cases, the beauty, the artistic beauty.\u201d It\u2019s an argument oft repeated when public tributes to the Confederacy face removal. These monuments, critics say, represent heritage and Southern pride, and taking them down is tantamount to erasing history. But many others view the monuments as symbols of racism and intimidation, honoring an illegitimate entity that sought to preserve the institutions of white supremacy and slavery. After all, proponents of pulling down statues point out, most Confederate monuments were erected decades after the end of the Civil War, at a time when Black Americans\u2019 civil rights were \u201caggressively under attack,\u201d in the words of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Ryan Best. This map visualizes the researchers' findings, with darker colors denoting higher numbers of lynching victims and each dot representing the location of a Confederate memorialization. Graphic by Samuel Powers \/ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Now, reports Gillian Brockell for the Washington Post, a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences outlines evidence that Confederate monuments are indeed linked to a history of racial violence. Researchers at the University of Virginia (UVA) found that in former Confederate states, counties with higher numbers of Confederate monuments had higher numbers of lynchings between 1832 and 1950\u2014a trend \u201cconsistent with the position that Confederate memorializations reflect a racist history, one marred by intentions to terrorize and intimidate Black Americans in response to Black progress,\u201d according to the study. White mobs committed brutal acts of extrajudicial violence against nearly 2,000 Black Americans during Reconstruction (1865\u20131876), a tumultuous period following the Civil War during which the country\u2019s laws and Constitution were reworked to grant basic rights to the formerly enslaved. These lynchings were \u201cintended to maintain white supremacy, suppress civil rights, instill fear and terrorize Black people,\u201d the authors write in the study. The researchers focused their investigation on the areas where the most lynchings took place: the 11 former Confederate states of Virginia, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas and Alabama. They obtained county-level data on lynching from two sources, including an Equal Justice Initiative registry documenting racially motivated killings that took between 1877 and 1950. County-level counts of Confederate memorials came from the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Whose Heritage? project, which tracks monuments that have been removed and those that still stand. Photograph of the 1913 unveiling of UNC Chapel Hill's Silent Sam monument Public domain via Wikimedia Commons Even when controlling for demographic factors like population numbers, the researchers found that \u201ccounty-level frequency of lynching predicts county-level frequency of Confederate memorializations.\u201d The paper does not make any causal claims, and the researchers \u201ccan\u2019t pinpoint exactly the cause and effect,\u201d says co-author Sophie Trawalter, an expert on public policy and psychology at UVA, in a statement. \u201cBut,\u201d Trawalter adds, \u201cthe association is clearly there. At a minimum, the data suggests that localities with attitudes and intentions that led to lynchings also had attitudes and intentions associated with the construction of Confederate memorials.\u201d The findings become even more powerful, the researchers say, when one considers the times and places that the monuments were erected, as well as the contents of speeches given at the memorials\u2019 dedications. As an example, the paper cites a speech delivered by a Confederate veteran at the 1913 dedication ceremony for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s Silent Sam monument. He claimed that Confederate soldiers \u201csaved the very life of the Anglo-Saxon race in the South\u201d and stated that he had publicly whipped a Black woman after the conclusion of the Civil War. Per the paper, the team hopes that its findings, which provide empirical data showing a correlation between Confederate monuments and racial terror killings, will help Americans move on from the debate over controversial statues\u2014and perhaps gain some clarity on how to deal with these public works. \u201cThis kind of [research] is important because it takes a debate that feels like two sides, that feels like two equally valid opinions, and contributes by acknowledging that there are empirical questions at the center of these debates,\u201d first author Kyshia Henderson, a psychologist at UVA, tells Erin O\u2019Hare of Charlottesville Tomorrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to yield to the position that these symbols are not at all associated with hate.

Now, reports Johnny Diaz for the New York Times, a sculpture of an Indigenous woman is set to replace the controversial explorer\u2019s likeness.

Designed by Mexican sculptor Pedro Reyes, the soon-to-be installed statue is titled Tlalli\u2014the Nahuatl word for water. It depicts a woman from the Olmec civilization, which inhabited present-day Mexico between roughly 1400 and 400 B.C.E., as Taylor Dafoe writes for Artnet News. The first major civilization in Mexico, the Olmec are best known today for their massive sculptures of human heads. \u201cIt is very important to dedicate a monument to Indigenous women and to the earth, because if someone can teach us how to take care of this planet, it is our native peoples and that is precisely what we must learn again,\u201d Reyes tells Mexican newspaper El Universal, per a translation by Artnet News. \u201cWe all come from the land and we all return to it, and it is the land that should be in our mind\u2014and not only in the past.\u201d En el marco del #D\u00edaInternacionalDeLaMujerInd\u00edgena anunciamos que en la glorieta donde se ubicaba la estatua de Col\u00f3n, se colocar\u00e1 una escultura que reivindica a las mujeres, de cara a los #500A\u00f1osDeResistenciaInd\u00edgena.#CiudadDeDerechos pic.twitter.com\/4CinthlvDY\u2014 Gobierno CDMX (@GobCDMX) September 5, 2021 Last October, city authorities pulled the 19th-century Columbus statue from its pedestal in the Paseo de la Reforma, a major street that cuts through the heart of Mexico City. Though officials claimed that the work was removed for restoration, some onlookers suspected that the decision was made in anticipation of protests on D\u00eda de la Raza, as Columbus Day is known in Spanish-speaking countries. Protesters routinely defaced the sculpture with spray paint during demonstrations, the Associated Press (AP) reported at the time. Sculpted by French artist Charles Cordier in 1877, the bronze statue depicts Italian explorer Columbus as a conqueror. He stands with one hand raised and the other lifting a veil off of a globe. Columbus\u2019 gesture refers to an outdated history that casts the explorer as the \u201cdiscoverer\u201d of the Americas. In truth, Columbus ventured to the Caribbean in 1492 and met the Ta\u00edno people\u2014one of many civilizations that had been living across North America for tens of thousands of years. The explorer enslaved and killed thousands of Indigenous people; his actions paved the way for European colonization of the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade.

The guidelines are not yet final but may affect tens of millions of adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, reports Roni Caryn Rabin for the New York Times.

The drug seems to most help individuals who already have, or are at a high risk for, cardiovascular disease. The panel found some evidence that baby aspirin may only benefit people between 40 and 60 years of age who have a 10 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke, per the Associated Press. However, aspirin can also cause life-threatening bleeding in the digestive tract or brain, per the New York Times. One study published in 2018 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of bleeding from an aspirin regimen outweighs its potential benefits for those over 70 years of age, Gizmodo reports. The USPTF made their assessments based on a literature review of data from recent trials and population studies. For older people who have no risks of heart disease, the potential for bleeding damage outweighs any aspirin benefits. \u201cWhen we looked at the literature, most of it suggested the net balance is not favorable for most people \u2014 there was more bleeding than heart attacks prevented,\u201d says Amit Khera, an author of the guideline, to the New York Times. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t nose bleeds, this can be bleeding in the brain.\u201d The draft recommendation statement is currently open for public comment until November 8, before a final version of the report Is published, the New York Times reports. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a blanket statement that everybody who\u2019s at increased risk for heart disease, even though they never had a heart attack, should be on aspirin,\u201d Tseng explains to the New York Times. \u201cWe need to be smarter at matching primary prevention to the people who will benefit the most and have the least risk of harm.\u201d Elizabeth Gamillo | | READ MORE Elizabeth Gamillo is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian and a science journalist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Heart Disease Post a Comment","99":"Tompson (far left) with colleagues Dot Smith, Walt Disney and Donna Luppo in an undated photo Walt Disney Company As a child growing up in Los Angeles in the 1920s, Ruthie Tompson passed by the first Disney film studio every day on her way to school. Each day, she peered inside the windows and watched the animators at work\u2014until someone took notice of her and invited her inside. \u201cI think it was Walt [Disney] because he roamed around quite a bit,\u201d Tompson later recalled. She became such a fixture at the studio that Walt\u2019s brother, Roy, brought an apple box for her to sit on, transfixed, as animations came to life around her. \u201c[A]s it got late, he would say, \u2018I think you\u2019d better go home. Your mother probably wants you to come home for dinner.\u2019\u201d These visits marked the start of Tompson\u2019s long, fruitful association with the Walt Disney Company. After graduating from high school, she formally joined the studio as an inker and painter, transferring animators\u2019 drawings from paper onto \u201ccels,\u201d or celluloid sheets used in the filmmaking process. Over the next 40-odd years, she took on roles in final check, scene planning and the camera department. Her work\u2014\u201dlargely unheralded,\u201d writes Margalit Fox for the New York Times\u2014helped shape many of the beloved children\u2019s films produced during Disney\u2019s Golden Age, among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, The Aristocats and Robin Hood. Tompson retired from Disney in 1975. Walt Disney Company On October 10, at the age of 111, Tompson \u201cpassed away peacefully in her sleep\u201d at her home in the Motion Picture and Television Fund\u2019s retirement community in Woodland Hills, California, Disney announced in a statement. \u201cRuthie was a legend among animators,\u201d says Bob Iger, executive chairman of the Walt Disney Company, in the statement. \u201cWhile we will miss her smile and wonderful sense of humor, her exceptional work and pioneering spirit will forever be an inspiration to us all.\u201d Born in Portland, Maine, in 1910, Tompson moved to California with her family when she was 8 years old. Her childhood was suffused with Disney: She lived down the street from Robert Disney, Walt\u2019s uncle, and in addition to being a regular observer of the Disney film studio, appeared as a live-action reference model for an early series of shorts, the Alice Comedies. She received 25 to 50 cents for each picture and used the money to buy licorice. When she was 18, Tompson took a job at a riding academy in the San Fernando Valley, where the Disney brothers often played polo. Though he had not seen her since she was a child, Walt recognized her \u201csignature Buster Brown haircut,\u201d and invited her to work with him, wrote Patricia Zohn for Vanity Fair in 2010. Tompson replied that she couldn\u2019t \u201cdraw worth a nickel,\u201d but Disney was undeterred, promising that the studio would send her to night school so she could learn the craft of inking and painting. The first film Tompson worked on was the studio\u2019s first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. She joined a group of about 100 women, some of them \u201cprofoundly gifted artists\u201d who were barred from animation jobs because of their gender, per the Times. Tompson didn\u2019t have the steady, delicate touch needed to work with the inkers, who \u201cnot only had to trace the animators\u2019 pencil lines exactly but also had to capture the feeling of what the animators were intending in the scenes,\u201d according to the Walt Disney Family Museum. Instead, she was assigned to paint in the lines that had been traced by the inkers. Soon, Tompson was promoted to the position of final checker, making her responsible for reviewing animation cels before they were photographed onto film. \u201cOut of a 500-cel scene, every four or five would be painted by a different girl, so the colors had to follow through,\u201d she explained in 2007. \u201cIf they put blue in the wrong place, we\u2019d have to take them back and have them redo them.\u201d In 1948, Tompson began working as both an animation checker reviewing artists\u2019 work for inconsistencies and a scene planner\u2014a role that required her to guide how the camera should move to bring vitality to the animations. Tompson was named a Disney legend in 2000. Walt Disney Company \u201cShe really had to know all the mechanics of making the image work on the screen as the director, the layout person and the animator preferred: how to make Peter Pan walk, or fly, in the specified time,\u201d John Canemaker, a historian and Oscar-winning animator, tells the Times. \u201cWhat she did ended up on the screen\u2014whether you see her hand or not\u2014because of the way she supported the directors\u2019 vision.\u201d Though she operated behind the scenes, Tompson\u2019s technical skill was recognized when she became one of the first three women admitted to the International Photographers Union, reports Rachel Treisman for NPR. She continued working for Disney until her retirement from the studio in 1975, making invaluable contributions to \u201cvirtually every Disney animated feature up through The Rescuers,\u201d per the statement. In 2000, Tompson was named a Disney Legend, a title bestowed for exceptional contributions to the company. Last year, in honor of Tompson\u2019s 110th birthday, a celebration was held at the Motion Picture & Television Fund campus. Staff decorated the halls according to Tompson\u2019s two passions: Disney and the Dodgers. When asked the secret to her longevity, Tompson joked that she was a vampire before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am still here, but I know that I don\u2019t want to be revered for how old I am. I want to be known for who I am.\u201d Brigit Katz | | READ MORE Brigit Katz is a freelance writer based in Toronto.

Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute Cheetahs Rosalie and Nick are excited to announce the birth of quintuplets. The proud parents welcomed five healthy cheetah cubs on October 12 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia, reports Jane Recker of the Washingtonian. The spotted spawn were born within a span of six hours\u20145:20, 8:24, 9:42, 10:33 and 11:17 a.m. ET. Rosalie, the five-year-old mother, can be seen caring for her bountiful brood on a live streaming webcam provided by Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute. \u201cSeeing Rosalie successfully care for this litter\u2014her first\u2014with confidence is very rewarding,\u201d Adrienne Crosier, SCBI\u2019s cheetah reproductive biologist, says in a statement. \u201cBeing able to witness the first moments of a cheetah\u2019s life is incredibly special. As webcam viewers watch our cheetah family grow, play and explore their surroundings, we hope the experience brings them joy and helps them feel a deeper connection to this vulnerable species.\u201d With less than 7,500 cheetahs in the wild, the species has been labeled \u201cvulnerable to extinction\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Cheetahs live in small, isolated populations mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where their numbers are being decimated by human conflict, poaching, and habitat and prey-base loss, according to the SCBI statement. Since 2007, 16 litters of cheetah cubs have been born at SCBI, including a family of four in 2020. In September, SCBI staff took over care of a day-old cub that was abandoned by its mother due to lack of milk stimulation. The baby was bottle-fed by hand for 17 days until it could be sent to an adoptive mother cheetah at a breeding facility in Oregon, where it is now thriving. SCBI is part of the Cheetah Breeding Center Coalition\u2014a group of ten breeding centers across the United States that maintain a sustainable North American cheetah population under human care, reports the Washingtonian. Crosier coordinates the effort through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 Cheetah Species Survival Plan, which she heads. SCBI spearheads research programs at its headquarters in Virginia, National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and field research stations and training sites worldwide. Scientists at the facility tackle complex conservation challenges by applying knowledge of animal behavior and reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration and conservation sustainability, the SCBI statement says. Mom and her babies can be viewed on the cheetah cam until the cubs leave the den. The new family has access to other areas at the facility, so it is possible they may be off-camera if they go out and explore. Genders of the cute cubs are not known at this time since SCBI keepers have not been able to examine the brood in person yet. Rosalie is doing well, though is understandably tired after giving birth to the five cheetah cherubs. The father, ten-year-old Nick was the first cheetah ever born at SCBI.

NurPhoto via Getty Images Earlier this week pharmaceutical company Merck announced it has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use of what could be the first-ever pill to treat Covid-19. Because the antiviral drug can be delivered in series of convenient and relatively inexpensive capsules, some experts say it could be a game-changer in the fight against the virus. If the pill is approved by the FDA\u2014which could happen in a matter of weeks\u2014millions of Americans could be eligible to receive it. All other approved Covid-19 treatments must be delivered intravenously or injected by a medical professional, while the capsule could be taken at home as soon as symptoms appear. The pill, which contains the antiviral drug molnupiravir, won\u2019t be a fix-all for the pandemic, but it will provide public health experts with another tool in their arsenal. Experts say vaccinations are the best way to protect oneself from infection, but the new antiviral medication provides a better shot for those that do fall ill. Around 68 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, underscoring the need for safe and effective treatments for Covid-19 infections. \u201cThe value here is that it\u2019s a pill so you don\u2019t have to deal with the infusion centers and all the factors around that,\u201d says Nicholas Kartsonis, a senior vice president with Merck\u2019s infectious disease unit, to Matthew Perrone of the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful tool to add to the toolbox.\u201d The drug molnupiravir, which was first tested for influenza, works by interfering with the way SARS-CoV-2 replicates inside our cells, causing mutations that kill the virus. In the company\u2019s clinical trials, they reported that the pill halved hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated adults infected with Covid-19. The study group included adults who were already showing symptoms and were at a high risk of severe disease. The company says it\u2019s seeking authorization for its pill to be given only to high-risk adults, like those over 60 or with other risk factors like obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. The results are not peer-reviewed, and the FDA will examine Merck\u2019s studies on the drug before making a decision, reports Cassandra Willyard for Nature. Eventually, the FDA could approve the drug for lower-risk Americans, too. The medication isn\u2019t a one-and-done pill: the company says people will have to take four pills twice a day for five days, for a total of 40 capsules. Merck, which is developing the pill with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, anticipates producing enough pills for 10 million people by the end of this year. A similar antiviral pill being developed by Pfizer and Atea Pharmaceuticals-Roche, reports Rebecca Robbins for the New York Times. The new medication could also provide relief to over-burdened hospitals, especially in places where vaccination rates are still low. The pills cost about a third of the price of intravenous monoclonal antibody treatments with a price tag of around $700 USD per patient, but that may still be too costly for some nations. \u201cAre we going to be in a situation where the price is reasonable in low- and middle-income countries?\u201d says Rachel Cohen, the North American executive director at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, to Nature. If those countries are able to get a supply of molnupiravir, they often lack the recourses needed to spot infections early. Because Merck\u2019s pill must be taken within the first five days of showing symptoms, \u201cthat requires that we are able to actually rapidly diagnose people,\u201d Cohen says, which \u201cis actually a huge challenge.\u201d Because clinical trials included only high-risk, unvaccinated people, it\u2019s not clear if the pill will be available to vaccinated people. A company spokeswoman said it would be up to the FDA to decide, according to the New York Times. Because of the way the drug works to kill the virus, people who are pregnant will not be eligible to receive the pills due to the risk of birth defects.

Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images The drought facing much of the American West is hurting the region\u2019s ability to generate electricity by throttling the water flowing through hydroelectric power plants, reports Michael Phillis for the Associated Press. A new report from the Energy Information Administration projects that because of the severe drought, hydropower generation will decline by nearly 14 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. California had to shut down Oroville Lake\u2019s Hyatt Power Plant in August when water levels dropped too low. At Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the Utah-Arizona border, water levels have plunged so low that the United States Bureau of Reclamation projects that the lake may no longer have enough water to generate electricity by 2023 if drought conditions persist, reports Dan Gearino for Inside Climate News. Losing Lake Powell\u2019s Glen Canyon Dam would require utility companies to find a new way to get electricity to the 5.8 million customers the dam currently supplies with power. Hydropower generation produces 7.3 percent of U.S. electricity. When that power supply falls short, states are likely to make up the difference by burning fossil fuels that exacerbate climate change, per Inside Climate. For example, California\u2019s hydropower has declined 38 percent compared to 2020 and in response, the state is expected to boost natural gas power by 7 percent, the AP reports. In the Pacific Northwest, the hydropower shortfall is predicted to increase coal power generation by 12 percent. Given all this, Inside Climate\u2019s Gearino poses the question of whether this means hydropower is becoming a less reliable power source as the U.S. tries to transition to using more renewable energy. Unsatisfyingly, the answer appears to be that we don\u2019t yet know. While temperatures are assuredly rising, the climate change\u2013driven changes in precipitation will vary significantly by region. But when severe drought and extreme heat collide, as they have this year, states like California that rely heavily on hydropower can be forced to buy extra power to meet demand, which tends to spike when temperatures soar, per the AP. Still, this year\u2019s drop in hydropower generation is not without precedent. Per Inside Climate, 2007 saw a 14.4 percent drop and in 2012 hydropower generation fell by 13.5 percent. But the fluctuations highlight the ways in which the extremes brought about by climate change are stressing human infrastructure and creating added challenges when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels.

FlickrDelusions via Flickr under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 The University of Oxford\u2019s Oriel College has installed a plaque identifying 19th-century politician and diamond-mining magnate Cecil Rhodes as a \u201ccommitted British colonialist.\u201d Placed beside a much-debated statue of Rhodes, the plaque immediately came under fire from both advocates of removing the sculpture and their opponents. Oxford city councilor Shaista Aziz, who was a member of the college\u2019s Independent Commission of Inquiry into the statue, calls the plaque \u201camateurish\u201d and \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d reports Indya Clayton for the Oxford Mail. Aziz adds that the sign does \u201cnothing to address the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, a loud, proud white supremacist, colonialist and slave owner and a deeply controversial figure of his time.\u201d The new plaque notes that the building where the statue stands was constructed with money bequeathed by Rhodes in his will. Upon his death in 1902, Rhodes, a former Oriel student, left the college the equivalent of about $17 million in today\u2019s dollars. The plaque states that Rhodes \"obtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\" Dan Hicks via Twitter Per the sign, Rhodes \u201cobtained his fortune through exploitation of minerals, land, and peoples of southern Africa.\u201d Though the college \u201cdeclared its wish to remove the statue\u201d following widespread protests against systemic racism last year, it opted not to do so in accordance with \u201clegal and regulatory advice.\u201d A line at the bottom of the plaque directs readers to a website featuring additional context about the statue and Rhodes himself. Cambridge historian David Abulafia tells the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Turner that the sign \u201clacks balance.\u201d \u201cHe believed he was bringing benefits to Africa,\u201d Abulafia says. \u201cWe might now argue that he did more harm than good, but one has to understand what his intentions were. He is portrayed here as some sort of devil incarnate.\u201dAs an @OrielOxford alumnus I am dismayed to see the sniveling cowardice shown in the face of the left-wing mob. Like many other Oriel graduates I am grateful for the education I received at Oxford in large part due to the generosity of Rhodes' bequest. https:\/\/t.co\/s1jsZKSy8r\u2014 Nile Gardiner (@NileGardiner) October 10, 2021 For more than a year, the Oxford statue has been a target of the Rhodes Must Fall movement, which began as a series of student-led protests in South Africa in 2015, as Justin Parkinson reported for BBC News at the time. Linking Rhodes\u2019 legacy to continuing inequity in wealth and opportunities in the country, protesters successfully campaigned for the removal of a prominent statue of Rhodes at the University of Cape Town. Founder of the De Beers diamond company, Rhodes served as prime minister of Britain\u2019s Cape Colony, in what\u2019s now South Africa, from 1890 to 1896. In addition to profiting enormously from the region\u2019s mineral wealth, Rhodes advocated for monumental expansion of the British Empire, including bringing the United States back under British control. He sought to create a \u201cred line\u201d on the map of Africa, with everything from Cairo to Cape Town belonging to Britain. \u201cI contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race,\u201d Rhodes once said. Last year, in the midst of global activism following the police killing of George Floyd, activists in Oxford demanded the removal of Rhode\u2019s likeness. Protesters around the world also toppled statues of other figures linked to slavery and colonialism, including Confederate generals and enslavers. In Bristol, an English city west of Oxford, a crowd dumped a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston into a nearby harbor.the Rhodes Must Fall Oxford campaign did not, from memory, call for the erection of a third college memorial to Cecil Rhodesthis small metal sign is an embarrassment and reveals the incoherence and futility of the ideology of \u201cRetain and Explain\u201d pic.twitter.com\/Ft50hPpVQ4\u2014 Dan Hicks (@profdanhicks) October 11, 2021 A majority of the independent commission\u2019s members supported removing Oriel\u2019s Rhodes statue. But the college decided in May that it would not do so, citing the difficult legal and planning process involved, per Jamie Grierson and Damien Gayle of the Guardian. According to the Oxford Mail, the new plaque is a temporary measure that will eventually be replaced with a permanent response to the controversy. In January, United Kingdom officials announced a new \u201cretain and explain\u201d policy that keeps controversial historical statues in place with added context. This week, the City of London Corporation announced that memorials to William Beckford and John Cass, politicians with ties to the transatlantic slave trade, would remain standing alongside new explanatory texts, reports Taylor Dafoe for Artnet News. \u201cIt enables us to acknowledge and address the legacy of our past with openness and honesty,\u201d says Doug Barrow, chair of a subcommittee that considered the Beckford and Cass statues, in a statement. \u201cNot to try and erase history but to place it in its proper context.\u201d Livia Gershon | | READ MORE Livia Gershon is a daily correspondent for Smithsonian.
